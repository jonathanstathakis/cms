The chemical analysis method involving SPME-GC-MS provided a complete volatile component of the extra virgin olive oils that was used to relate to the S3 multisensory responses. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) analysis were carried out on the set of data acquired from the sensor array to determine the best sensors for these tasks and to assess the capability of the system to identify various olive oil samples. k-NN classification rates were found to be 94.3% and 94.7% in the two phases, respectively.

This is the first study employing a short reaction flow (RF) chromatography column (length 50 mm) for the analysis of phenolics in complex samples (not a standard mixture of compounds). RF separation efficiency was high as the detectors are multiplexed simultaneously, rather than sequentially. The delay time between RF detection responses is minor (1.2 s) providing simple peak assignment between the phenolic detection and conventional detectors, such as the UV and fluorescence detectors (FLD).\nThirty-nine phenolics were detected amongst the five different tea samples (three from Camellia sinensis and two herbal teas). The highest number of phenols detected was 24 for English Breakfast tea (four highly abundant), 19 for Earl Grey (six highly abundant), 13 in Pure Green (two highly abundant) and 9 in both Fruit of the Forest (two highly abundant) and Camomile (none highly abundant) herbal teas. Numerous low concentration phenolic compounds in the Fruit of the Forest tea were not included due to their abundance being only slightly above the noise level of the detection process. The relative response factor (RRF) analysed at 520 and 500 nm aided to identify unique phenolics to each sample with similar retention times; three phenolics were unique to the Pure Green tea (2.30, 4.11 and 5.80 min) and two to the Earl Grey Tea (4.11 and 5.80 The Fruit of the Forest tea and the Camomile tea were both distinctly different from all other teas.

Detailed assessment of the peaks (based largely on retention time) that were observed in both detection modes for five beverage samples (four teas and one coffee) revealed the presence of a total of 56 compounds. Eight compounds were not detected by the FRAP assay and 13 were not observed by the phenolic assay. A geometric approach to factor analysis (GAFA) was applied to the detection sensitivity, and this analysis showed the correlation between these two assays was 0.67 and the spreading angle between the detection vectors was 47. Such outcomes are usually indicative of a multidimensional separation approach, but in this study this was achieved only from the detection protocol. Hence, when employing PCD to determine the 'activity' of samples derived from natural origin, testing should be conducted using multiple selective detection processes. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The resolving power and sensitivity obtained were similar to an analytical scale (4.6 mm i.d.) RF HPLC column of the same format. However, the baseline noise experienced was higher when the assay was scaled down from the RF 4.6 mm i.d. to the RF 2.1 mm i.d. narrow bore column. The PCD mixing and reaction speed inside the RF column outlet (frit and head-fitting design) enabled the coupling of PCD protocols with \"UHPLC-type\" low volume columns and systems without significant loss in separation performance. In comparison to a conventional analytical scale PCD approach the scaled down narrow bore RF approach demonstrated 40 times greater sensitivity in terms of S/N.

The discrimination was conducted by measuring the caffeine and chlorogenic acid content in the beans using UV-Vis spectroscopy. The data related to both compounds was processed using linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Information about the diffuse reflectance (log 1/R) spectra of intact beans was determined by NIR spectroscopy and analyzed using multivariate analysis. UV-Vis spectroscopy attained an accuracy of 97% in comparison to NIR spectroscopy’s accuracy by selected wavelengths of LDA (95%).

Several statistical or geometrical criteria can potentially be used to measure the degree of orthogonality. A comparison of eight candidate criteria has been carried out in this study. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to evaluate the relevance of each criterion and its ability to reveal the significance of the influence of factors like pH, stationary phase, and organic modifier. Experimentally, a set of 32 chromatographic systems was evaluated by the same generic gradient with 63 probe solutes, likely to be present in biological and/or environmental samples and covering a wide range of physico-chemical properties: acidic, basic and neutral compounds with different pKa, molecular mass and hydrophobicity (logP). Each chromatographic system was defined by the nature of the stationary phase (8 different silica or grafting chemistries), the pH of the aqueous fraction of the mobile phase (2.5 or 7.0) and the nature of the organic modifier (acetonitrile or methanol). The orthogonality of the 496 couples of chromatographic systems was evaluated and ranked using the eight different approaches: the three correlation coefficients (Pearson, Spearman and Kendall), two geometric criteria characterizing the coverage of the 2D separation space, Slonecker's information similarity and two chi-square statistics of independence between normalized retention times. In fact, there were only seven distinct criteria, since we established the analytical equivalence between the rankings with the likelihood ratio statistics and Slonecker's information similarity. Kendall's correlation coefficient appeared to be the best measure of orthogonality since, according to ANOVA, it exhibited the highest sensitivity to all experimental factors. The chi-square measures, and hence Slonecker's information similarity, performed equally well provided the discretization of the separation space was carried out appropriately. Finally, from the compared study of the factors acting upon orthogonality carried out by ANOVA, it is possible to draw the conclusion that the pH of the mobile phases has the highest impact on the selectivity followed by the type of stationary phase and finally by the organic modifier.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Al Bakain","given":"Ramia"},{"family":"Rivals","given":"Isabelle"},{"family":"Sassiat","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Thiébaut","given":"Didier"},{"family":"Hennion","given":"Marie-Claire"},{"family":"Euvrard","given":"Guillaume"},{"family":"Vial","given":"Jérôme"}],"citation-key":"albakain2011","container-title":"Journal of Chromatography A","container-title-short":"Journal of Chromatography A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2011.03.031","ISSN":"0021-9673","issue":"20","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",5,20]]},"language":"en","page":"2963-2975","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Comparison of different statistical approaches to evaluate the orthogonality of chromatographic separations: Application to reverse phase systems","title-short":"Comparison of different statistical approaches to evaluate the orthogonality of chromatographic separations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967311003797","volume":"1218"},{"id":"aleixandre-tudo_SpectrophotometricAnalysisPhenolic_2017","abstract":"Phenolic compounds are of crucial importance for red wine color and mouthfeel attributes. A large number of enzymatic and chemical reactions involving phenolic compounds take place during winemaking and aging. Despite the large number of published analytical methods for phenolic analyses, the values obtained may vary considerably. In addition, the existing scientific knowledge needs to be updated, but also critically evaluated and simplified for newcomers and wine industry partners. The most used and widely cited spectrophotometric methods for grape and wine phenolic analysis were identified through a bibliometric search using the Science Citation Index-Expanded (SCIE) database accessed through the Web of Science (WOS) platform from Thompson Reuters. The selection of spectrophotometry was based on its ease of use as a routine analytical technique. On the basis of the number of citations, as well as the advantages and disadvantages reported, the modified Somers assay appears as a multistep, simple, and robust procedure that provides a good estimation of the state of the anthocyanins equilibria. Precipitation methods for total tannin levels have also been identified as preferred protocols for these types of compounds. Good reported correlations between methods (methylcellulose precipitable vs bovine serum albumin) and between these and perceived red wine astringency, in combination with the adaptation to high-throughput format, make them suitable for routine analysis. The bovine serum albumin tannin assay also allows for the estimation of the anthocyanins content with the measurement of small and large polymeric pigments. Finally, the measurement of wine color using the CIELab space approach is also suggested as the protocol of choice as it provides good insight into the wine’s color properties.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Aleixandre-Tudo","given":"Jose Luis"},{"family":"Buica","given":"Astrid"},{"family":"Nieuwoudt","given":"Helene"},{"family":"Aleixandre","given":"Jose Luis"},{"family":"Toit","given":"Wessel","non-dropping-particle":"du"}],"citation-key":"aleixandre-tudo_SpectrophotometricAnalysisPhenolic_2017","container-title":"Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry","container-title-short":"J.

The progression over time of the bibliometric indicators was also presented and discussed. Chemometrics appeared as a proliﬁc and healthy research ﬁeld with increased funding received in the last decade. PCA, PLS and DA are still the preferred methods for most applications.

Here, ATR-FTIR spectroscopy coupled with a partial least squares regression (PLSR) chemometric tool was used for the detection of the misuse of such substances. Bambuterol and its metabolite terbutaline have been included in the list of prohibited doping agents. Therefore, we used bambuterol and terbutaline as models for the accurate and simultaneous qualitative and quantitative analysis of bambuterol and terbutaline in human urine samples. The method was straightforward and once the urine samples were collected, they could be directly applied to the surface of the ZnSe prism (ATR unit) to get the results within one minute. A calibration set with a partial factorial design was used to develop the PLSR model that could be used to predict the concentration of unknown samples containing the two drugs. The developed method was carefully validated and successfully applied to the urine sample analysis of human volunteers. The drugs were quantified at nanogram level concentrations. A side-by-side comparison of the proposed method with the routine GC-MS method was performed to demonstrate the challenges and opportunities of each method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Algethami","given":"Faisal K."},{"family":"Eid","given":"Sherif M."},{"family":"Kelani","given":"Khadiga M."},{"family":"Elghobashy","given":"Mohamed R."},{"family":"Abd El-Rahman","given":"Mohamed K."}],"citation-key":"algethami_ChemicalFingerprintingQuantitative_2020","container-title":"Rsc Advances","container-title-short":"RSC Adv.","DOI":"10.1039/c9ra10033d","event-place":"Cambridge","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,17]]},"language":"English","note":"WOS:000517310200047","page":"7146-7154","publisher":"Royal Soc Chemistry","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"Web of Science Nextgen","title":"Chemical fingerprinting and quantitative monitoring of the doping drugs bambuterol and terbutaline in human urine samples using ATR-FTIR coupled with a PLSR chemometric tool","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2020/RA/C9RA10033D","volume":"10"},{"id":"allea-EuropeanCodeConduct-2017","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"ALLEA","given":""}],"citation-key":"allea-EuropeanCodeConduct-2017","event-place":"Berlin","ISBN":"978-3-00-055767-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"English","publisher":"ALLEA All European Academics","publisher-place":"Berlin","title":"The European Code of Conduct of Sciences for Research Integrity","type":"book","URL":"https://learn-ap-southeast-2-prod-fleet01-xythos.content.blackboardcdn.com/5df059da37b55/10308734?X-Blackboard-Expiration=1645552800000&X-Blackboard-Signature=kjVICLUf4wEKes10B1mlLFTECNLsMyVoPS4gbGQeWGg%3D&X-Blackboard-Client-Id=100287&response-cache-control=private%2C%20max-age%3D21600&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%27ALLEA-European-Code-of-Conduct-for-Research-Integrity-2017.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEAUaDmFwLXNvdXRoZWFzdC0yIkcwRQIgLFwKvJ4UJFQQQRhb6cJJyn2mwtGeXGwbSbIiKKijOm0CIQCQmeS%2B1Rf5ojtLIf7uGoYfeSndEp3iYAeQm%2BRsMU%2FotiqEBAheEAAaDDU1NjkwMzg2MTM2MSIMArUhYrWt8XeTaC4wKuEDopBJoCzoAr3gCbmy%2Fd5lP%2Bw87UZDr71HdL5UodfbjFYOrsQGl3wlZUo8ToTE6XJh2gJdzMZGtBbUjqEoLCa3QmHiCagdtqXSxApVaiR80KLQkwuu8UVNXE9OeNFUh2wShjL1FPmXBb%2FTARhz2cgmFPWencSuSMW07X168Yoh%2FXgQfKoek0buFnWk07CsfhXDKI4X31YHwwxGRGHa4TnsPcQJKS5Aew3jJII2ArK6T%2Fa%2F%2BFP4KJZtJdCeFYejkxiMH5W%2BE5b2i%2BCdUi7512zoQHhlQp49ghbaPVws8tfH6OS6PJW%2BXA9VS7rQd0q%2FEm%2F4qLaCZMTeESvIxWsom51jN4UYdRjRHkgDoArohhCQwmntDDn83UyrbQOYroLcu0kXiFng1ZkJNGmbUtuWQ9zNw0SMiqtixFToVtRYoENguR2NwaIoZQeHOjxk9kov0FrGJJLwBnxWB7MWocBUPuPR5O0TcjDere0YTHfz3LQJkSndinKKDwzzOwUuMxQHRG97e5F%2FIoZ9nIynkVavQvxLenns3CM4KW4S96f1XcTa8bPxAxZ7KJqOSnggRkQRYqBjfjPuBdxJFrbnCJAXIPzt3Xad36SsTBVao7xZJuFVjIVK68GP6jD%2BoxWouIKL%2BeEsfTDTvtOQBjqlAZvnxeiFIztxOY6xMhn6egINS2dhER2gaam6jxrlB47XUMfbhiSvFYHLE3lER%2FbxGsULDFtu9FUVAwjGGL4Q8PvX5R1QU0Wn2lnIWQHol%2B3x0cVBjkHZCDTuONdNUBnQN6BEKwiqT3UNZK4jrE1FluTLsd51E9i3BcaOir%2FSPbrejXtrQbiO7QGddBhyUg2MPtjYj1oJwF3gcMM54kNsLgUDkkzyPQ%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20220222T120000Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=21600&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAYDKQORRYURLCCBPJ%2F20220222%2Fap-southeast-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=7dc271e222bbcd17853d2946d9819c0b0a159a6d4c98f521eff17f21b2818bf7"},{"id":"allegranza_AnswerSymbolSet_2017","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"ALLEGRANZA","given":"Mauro"}],"citation-key":"allegranza_AnswerSymbolSet_2017","container-title":"History of Science and Mathematics Stack Exchange","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",3,23]]},"title":"Answer to \"Is the symbol for set membership $\\in$ derived from greek letter $\\epsilon$?\"","title-short":"Answer to \"Is the symbol for set membership $\\in$ derived from greek letter $\\epsilon$?","type":"post","URL":"https://hsm.stackexchange.com/a/5825"},{"id":"allen","abstract":"David Allen's Getting Things Done® (GTD®) is the work-life management system that alleviates overwhelm, and instills focus, clarity, and confidence.David Allen's Getting Things Done®","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Allen","given":"David"}],"citation-key":"allen","container-title":"Getting Things Done®","language":"en-US","title":"Getting Things Done","type":"webpage","URL":"https://gettingthingsdone.com/"},{"id":"alonso_analyticalmethodsuntargeted_2015","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Alonso","given":"Arnald"},{"family":"Marsal","given":"Sara"},{"family":"JuliÃ","given":"Antonio"}],"citation-key":"alonso_analyticalmethodsuntargeted_2015","container-title":"Frontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology","container-title-short":"Front.

Metabolomics is then used as an analytical tool to investigate the variability of the metabolic profile of wines due to a series of different factors involved during wine production, including terroir, pedoclimatic conditions, vintage, vineyard practices, wine-making, barrel maturation, and aging.

to the importance of antioxidants in the protection of both natural and man-made materials, a large variety of testing methods have been proposed and applied. These include methods based on inhibited autoxidation studies, which are better followed by monitoring the kinetics of oxygen consumption or of the formation of hydroperoxides, the primary oxidation products. Analytical determination of secondary oxidation products (e.g. carbonyl compounds) has also been used. The majority of testing methods, however, do not involve substrate autoxidation. They are based on the competitive bleaching of a probe (e.g. ORAC assay, β-carotene, crocin bleaching assays, and luminol assay), on reaction with a diﬀerent probe (e.g. spin-trapping and TOSC assay), or they are indirect methods based on the reduction of persistent radicals (e.g. galvinoxyl, DPPH and TEAC assays), or of inorganic oxidizing species (e.g. FRAP, CUPRAC and Folin-Ciocalteu assays). Yet other methods are speciﬁc for preventive antioxidants.

Various methods may facilitate the writing process including outlining the paper before the actual writing and using dictation instead of writing the first draft. The aim of this study was to investigate the experiences and difficulties for young, experienced researchers when writing articles using a detailed outline and dictation of the first draft.Methods:We used qualitative focus group interviews and the study was reported according to the COnsolidated criteria for REporting Qualitative research guideline. Participants were sampled from a group of researchers participating in a writing retreat/course. The interviews were recorded on a digital recorder and transcribed. The text was analyzed according to content analysis and coded and condensed into themes and subthemes. Groups of participants were added until data saturation was reached.Results:A total of 14 researchers participated (9 women and 5 men). Their clinical experience was median (range) of 6 (1?11)?years since graduation from medical school. Two themes arose during the analyses of the data: ?Process guidance with the outline as the map? and ?arrival at dictation.? The outline was used in the preparation phase leading up to the day of dictation and was used in collaboration with co-authors and supervisors. The participants found it to be a useful tool for preparing the manuscript and dictating their initial first full draft.Conclusion:Experienced young researchers found beneficial effects of using a structured outline to prepare for dictation of scientific articles. The outline was a tool that would develop in close collaboration with co-authors and mentors. With dictation, a full first draft of a manuscript can be produced in a few hours. Participants positively evaluated this structured and reproducible way of producing scientific articles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Andresen","given":"Kristoffer"},{"family":"Laursen","given":"Jannie"},{"family":"Rosenberg","given":"Jacob"}],"citation-key":"andresen2018","container-title":"SAGE Open Medicine","container-title-short":"SAGE Open Medicine","DOI":"10.1177/2050312118778728","ISSN":"2050-3121","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,1]]},"page":"2050312118778728","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Outlining and dictating scientific manuscripts is a useful method for health researchers: A focus group interview","title-short":"Outlining and dictating scientific manuscripts is a useful method for health researchers","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/2050312118778728","volume":"6"},{"id":"anthony_libraryintegratedsimplismaalsdeconvolution_2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Anthony","given":"Ian G.

The Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research (the Code) articulates the\nbroad principles that characterise an honest, ethical and conscientious research culture. It establishes\na framework for responsible research conduct that provides a foundation for high-quality research,\ncredibility and community trust in the research endeavour. It outlines the expectations for the conduct of\nresearch in Australia or research conducted under the auspices of Australian institutions.\nThe primary responsibility for ensuring the integrity of research lies with individual researchers\nand institutions. The Code sets out principles and responsibilities that both researchers and institutions\nare expected to follow when conducting research. Critical to this endeavour are the moral leadership\nand espoused values of the institution and the shared values and expectations of honesty and integrity\nthat characterise an institution’s leadership and culture.\nThe previous version of the Code has served as an important point of reference to researchers\nand administrators. In addition, its widespread adoption has provided the Australian community, and\nthose responsible for funding research, with greater confidence in the integrity of research. This updated\nversion of the Code has the same goal, but is presented in a simpler way that more clearly articulates\nthe high-level principles, responsibilities and expectations that apply to all research across all disciplines.\nThis Code does not incorporate the laws, regulations and guidelines and other codes of practice that\napply to the conduct of research. Those responsible for the conduct of research are expected to be\naware of and comply with the applicable laws and codes.\nThe Code will be supported by a number of Guides that detail how to comply with the principles and\nresponsibilities of the Code. The advice is relevant to the diversity of Australian research institutions\nand research disciplines. Institutions and researchers are strongly encouraged to follow the advice\nin the Guides. For institutions, the Guides provide a reference for the development of processes that\npromote the principles and responsibilities of the Code.\nThe Code represents the core behaviours that characterise the responsible conduct of research. A failure\nto meet the principles and responsibilities set out in the Code is a breach of the Code. A breach of the\nCode occurs on a spectrum from minor breaches to those that are more serious. A serious breach of\nthe Code that is carried out with intent or recklessness or negligence is particularly egregious and may\nbe referred to as research misconduct. The Guide to Managing and Investigating Potential Breaches\nof the Code (the Investigation Guide) outlines the preferred model for institutions to use to investigate\nand manage potential breaches, determine any corrective actions to ensure the integrity of the research\nrecord and when a finding of research misconduct may be made.\nThe Australian Research Integrity Committee will use the Investigation Guide as a benchmark for\nreviewing how an institution funded by National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) or\nAustralian Research Council (ARC) has managed a potential breach of the Code.\nCompliance with this Code is a requirement for the receipt of funding by NHMRC and ARC.\nOther research agencies are encouraged to adopt this Code as a mandatory requirement.","author":[{"family":"arc","given":""}],"citation-key":"arc-AustralianCodeConductResearch-2018","ISBN":"978-1-86496-013-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","note":"suggested citation; Australian Code for the Responsible Conduct of Research 2018.

In addition, a neat separation of wines according to production area is obtained in terms of their relative contents of the P-coumaric acid ester of malvidin 3-glucoside.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Arozarena","given":"I."},{"family":"Casp","given":"A."},{"family":"Marín","given":"R."},{"family":"Navarro","given":"M."}],"citation-key":"arozarena_DifferentiationSpanishwines_2000","container-title":"European Food Research and Technology","container-title-short":"European Food Research and Technology","DOI":"10.1007/s002170000212","ISSN":"1438-2377, 1438-2385","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",12,5]]},"language":"en","page":"108-112","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Differentiation of some Spanish wines according to variety and region based on their anthocyanin composition","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s002170000212","volume":"212"},{"id":"arvanitoyannis_Applicationqualitycontrol_1999","author":[{"family":"Arvanitoyannis","given":"I S"},{"family":"Katsota","given":"M N"},{"family":"Psarra","given":"E P"},{"family":"SouØeros","given":"E H"},{"family":"Kallithraka","given":"S"}],"citation-key":"arvanitoyannis_Applicationqualitycontrol_1999","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Application of quality control methods for assessing wine authenticity: Use of multivariate analysis (chemometrics)","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"ascension_aml10_2022","author":[{"family":"Ascension","given":""}],"citation-key":"ascension_aml10_2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"title":"Applied Machine Learning: 10","type":"manuscript"},{"id":"ascension_classification_2022","author":[{"family":"Ascension","given":""}],"citation-key":"ascension_classification_2022","container-title":"Applied Machine Learning","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"title":"3.

Combined with the demand for expansion in the STEM workforce, various retention reforms have been proposed, implemented, and in some cases integrated into policy following evidence of success. Still, new findings, technological advances, and socio-cultural shifts inevitably necessitate an ongoing investigation as to how students approach learning. Among other factors, students who enter college without effective study skills are at much greater risk of being unsuccessful in their coursework. In order to construct an equitable learning environment, a mechanism must be developed to provide underprepared students with access to resources or interventions designed to refine the skills they need to be successful in the course. Early, reliable assessments can provide predictions of individual student outcomes in order to guide the development and implementation of such targeted interventions. In the present study, a model is developed to predict students’ odds of success based on their study approaches, as measured by their responses to twelve survey items from an existing instrument used in the Chemistry Education Research literature designed to measure students’ deep and surface learning approaches. The model’s prediction specificity ranges from 66.5% to 86.9% by semester. Two distinct sets of lower-performing students are identified in the data: those who align predominantly with surface approaches to learning versus those who indicate using both deep and surface approaches to learning. This supports the idea of a tailored approach to interventions, rather than a one-size-fits-all solution. Results from this instrument were correlated to students’ reported study methods and beliefs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Atieh","given":"Emily L."},{"family":"York","given":"Darrin M."},{"family":"Muñiz","given":"Marc N."}],"citation-key":"atieh2021","container-title":"Journal of Chemical Education","container-title-short":"J.

While summary statistics are among the most efficient and convenient tools for exploring and describing sets of data, they are often overlooked in EDA. In this paper, we show multiple case studies that compare the performance, including clustering, of a series of summary statistics in EDA. The summary statistics considered here are pattern recognition entropy (PRE), the mean, standard deviation (STD), 1-norm, range, sum of squares (SSQ), and X4, which are compared with principal component analysis (PCA), multivariate curve resolution (MCR), and/or cluster analysis. PRE and the other summary statistics are direct methods for analyzing data—they are not factor-based approaches. To quantify the performance of summary statistics, we use the concept of the “critical pair,” which is employed in chromatography. The data analyzed here come from different analytical methods. Hyperspectral images, including one of a biological material, are also analyzed. In general, PRE outperforms the other summary statistics, especially in image analysis, although a suite of summary statistics is useful in exploring complex data sets. While PRE results were generally comparable to those from PCA and MCR, PRE is easier to apply. For example, there is no need to determine the number of factors that describe a data set. Finally, we introduce the concept of divided spectrum-PRE (DS-PRE) as a new EDA method. DS-PRE increases the discrimination power of PRE. We also show that DS-PRE can be used to provide the inputs for the k-nearest neighbor (kNN) algorithm. We recommend PRE and DS-PRE as rapid new tools for unsupervised EDA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Avval","given":"Tahereh G."},{"family":"Moeini","given":"Behnam"},{"family":"Carver","given":"Victoria"},{"family":"Fairley","given":"Neal"},{"family":"Smith","given":"Emily F."},{"family":"Baltrusaitis","given":"Jonas"},{"family":"Fernandez","given":"Vincent"},{"family":"Tyler","given":"Bonnie.

The fourth edition gives an expanded treatment of the singular value decomposition and its consequences. It includes a new chapter on multilinear algebra, treating bilinear forms, quadratic forms, tensor products, and an approach to determinants via alternating multilinear forms. This new edition also increases the use of the minimal polynomial to provide cleaner proofs of multiple results. Also, over 250 new exercises have been added. The novel approach taken here banishes determinants to the end of the book. The text focuses on the central goal of linear algebra: understanding the structure of linear operators on finite-dimensional vector spaces. The author has taken unusual care to motivate concepts and simplify proofs. A variety of interesting exercises in each chapter helps students understand and manipulate the objects of linear algebra. Beautiful formatting creates pages with an unusually student-friendly appearance in both print and electronic versions. No prerequisites are assumed other than the usual demand for suitable mathematical maturity. The text starts by discussing vector spaces, linear independence, span, basis, and dimension. The book then deals with linear maps, eigenvalues, and eigenvectors. Inner-product spaces are introduced, leading to the finite-dimensional spectral theorem and its consequences. Generalized eigenvectors are then used to provide insight into the structure of a linear operator","author":[{"family":"Axler","given":"Sheldon Jay"}],"citation-key":"axler_linearalgebradone_2024","collection-title":"Undergraduate texts in mathematics","edition":"Fourth edition","event-place":"Cham Heidelberg New York Dordrecht London","ISBN":"978-3-031-41025-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"389","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Cham Heidelberg New York Dordrecht London","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Linear algebra done right","type":"book"},{"id":"ba_ComprehensiveQualityEvaluation_2021","abstract":"Introduction Polygoni Orientalis Fructus (POF) is a clinically effective Chinese medicine. Raw POF (RPOF) and POF Tostus (POFT) are used separately in clinics. However, incomplete progress has been made on quality control. Objective To establish a comprehensive method for quality assessment of RPOF and POFT and to discriminate these two varieties. Methodology High-performance liquid chromatography combined with the diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) methods were developed for fingerprinting and quantitative analysis of seven major compounds in RPOF and POFT, and the main components were determined by HPLC-DAD coupled with Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance-mass spectrometry. Chemometric approaches were performed to discriminate RPOF and POFT and to screen discriminatory components. Results Fingerprints were established and 12 common peaks were identified, cannabisin G and cannabisin E were firstly identified from POF. In quantitative analysis, all analytes showed good regression (R > 0.9996) within test ranges and the recovery of the method was in the range 96.6-104.3%. Fingerprints in conjunction with similarity analysis and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) demonstrated the consistent quality of RPOF and showed a clear discrimination between RPOF and POFT. Principal component analysis, partial least-squares discriminant analysis, and heatmap-HCA on quantitative data not only gave a clear differentiation between RPOF and POFT, but they also suggested that quercetin, 3,5,7-trihydroxychromone, and N-trans-feruloyltyramine acted as the main factors responsible for the sample differences. Conclusions Chromatographic analysis in combination with chemometric analysis provides a simple and reliable method of comparing and evaluating the qualities of RPOF and POFT.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Ba","given":"Yinying"},{"family":"Xiao","given":"Ran"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Qi-Jun"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Li-Yuan"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Rong-Rong"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xiao-Qing"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Xia"}],"citation-key":"ba_ComprehensiveQualityEvaluation_2021","container-title":"Phytochemical Analysis","container-title-short":"Phytochem.

Authentic testing of food and adulterant detection of various food products is required for value assessment and to assure consumer protection against fraudulent activities. Through this review we intend to compile different types of adulterations made in different food items, the health risks imposed by these adulterants and detection methods available for them. Concerns about food safety and regulation have ensured the development of various techniques like physical, biochemical/immunological and molecular techniques, for adulterant detection in food. Molecular methods are more preferable when it comes to detection of biological adulterants in food, although physical and biochemical techniques are preferable for detection of other adulterants in food.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Bansal","given":"Sangita"},{"family":"Singh","given":"Apoorva"},{"family":"Mangal","given":"Manisha"},{"family":"Mangal","given":"Anupam K."},{"family":"Kumar","given":"Sanjiv"}],"citation-key":"bansal2017","container-title":"Critical Reviews in Food Science and Nutrition","DOI":"10.1080/10408398.2014.967834","ISSN":"1040-8398","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",4,13]]},"page":"1174-1189","PMID":"26054861","publisher":"Taylor & Francis","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Food adulteration: Sources, health risks, and detection methods","title-short":"Food adulteration","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/10408398.2014.967834","volume":"57"},{"id":"bao2020a","abstract":"Microﬂuidics-based liquid chromatography is based on the miniaturization of the different types of liquid chromatography (LC) systems (e.g., afﬁnity, adsorption, size exclusion, ion exchange) on a microchip to perform on-chip separation of different types of analytes.

The literature presented in this review clearly reveals that near and mid-infrared approaches have a huge potential for gaining rapid information about the chemical composition and related properties of coffee. In addition to its ability for effectively quantifying and characterising quality attributes of some important features of coffee such as moisture, lipids and caffeine content, classification into quality grades and determination of sensory attributes, it is able to measure multiple chemical constituents simultaneously avoiding extensive sample preparation. Developing a quality evaluation system based on infrared spectral information to assess the coffee quality parameters and to ensure its authentication would bring economical benefits to the coffee industry by increasing consumer confidence in the quality of products. This paper provides an overview of the recently developed approaches and latest research carried out in near and mid-infrared spectral technology for evaluating the quality and composition of coffee and the possibility of its widespread deployment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Barbin","given":"Douglas Fernandes"},{"family":"Felicio","given":"Ana Lucia de Souza Madureira"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Da-Wen"},{"family":"Nixdorf","given":"Suzana Lucy"},{"family":"Hirooka","given":"Elisa Yoko"}],"citation-key":"barbin-ApplicationInfraredSpectral-2014","collection-title":"Coffee – Science, Technology and Impacts on Human Health","container-title":"Food Research International","container-title-short":"Food Research International","DOI":"10.1016/j.foodres.2014.01.005","ISSN":"0963-9969","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7,1]]},"language":"en","page":"23-32","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Application of infrared spectral techniques on quality and compositional attributes of coffee: An overview","title-short":"Application of infrared spectral techniques on quality and compositional attributes of coffee","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S096399691400009X","volume":"61"},{"id":"barbosa-UseAdvancedChemometric-2014","abstract":"This study examines the application of advanced data mining techniques associated with trace element concentrations for authenticity evaluation of organic coffee samples. Fifty-four coffee samples (20 organic and 34 nonorganic) were evaluated according to their macro and microelement contents to establish reference ranges and identify differences in patterns of chemical elements in both crop procedures. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for the determination of thirty-eight chemical elements (Al, As, B, Ba, Be, Bi, Cd, Ce, Co, Cr, Cs, Cu, Dy, Eu, Er, Gd, Ge, Ho, La, Lu, Mn, Mo, Ni, Pb, Rb, Se, Sm, Sr, Yb, W, U, Ta, Tb, Th, Ti, Tl, Zr and Zn). In general, higher levels of chemical elements were found in conventional coffee compared with organic samples. The classiﬁcation of samples was performed by using three well known data mining algorithms, named Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Naïve Bayes (NB). When all analyzed variables were considered, a 96.3% accuracy level was obtained with the three algorithms. The level of accuracy remained at 96.3% for SVM and MLP and rose to 98.2 for NB when only eight of the investigated minerals – i.e. Zn, Se, Ba, U, Dy, Tl, Th, Mo – were used for chemometric analysis. This level of accuracy provides a strong foundation to propose the combination of trace element spectral ﬁngerprints with data mining techniques as a valuable tool to evaluate the authenticity of organic coffee samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Barbosa","given":"Rommel Melgaço"},{"family":"Batista","given":"Bruno Lemos"},{"family":"Varrique","given":"Renan M."},{"family":"Coelho","given":"Vinicius A."},{"family":"Campiglia","given":"Andrés D."},{"family":"Barbosa","given":"Fernando"}],"citation-key":"barbosa-UseAdvancedChemometric-2014","container-title":"Food Research International","container-title-short":"Food Research International","DOI":"10.1016/j.foodres.2013.07.060","ISSN":"09639969","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",7]]},"language":"en","page":"246-251","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The use of advanced chemometric techniques and trace element levels for controlling the authenticity of organic coffee","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0963996913004262","volume":"61"},{"id":"barnaba_Nontargetedglycosidicprofiling_2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Barnaba","given":"C."},{"family":"Dellacassa","given":"E."},{"family":"Nicolini","given":"G."},{"family":"Nardin","given":"T."},{"family":"Serra","given":"M."},{"family":"Larcher","given":"R."}],"citation-key":"barnaba_Nontargetedglycosidicprofiling_2018","container-title":"Journal of Chromatography A","container-title-short":"Journal of Chromatography A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2018.05.008","ISSN":"00219673","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7]]},"language":"en","page":"75-89","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Non-targeted glycosidic profiling of international wines using neutral loss-high resolution mass spectrometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021967318305661","volume":"1557"},{"id":"basalekou_wineauthenticitytraceability_2020","abstract":"Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) has gained popularity in the wine sector due to its simplicity and ability to provide a wine's fingerprint.

Study of the distribution of publications over various chemistry research areas revealed that analytical chemistry and biochemistry are integrating AI to the greatest extent and with the highest growth rates. We also investigated trends in interdisciplinary research and identified frequently occurring combinations of research areas in publications. Furthermore, topic analyses were conducted for journal and patent publications to illustrate emerging associations of AI with certain chemistry research topics. Notable publications in various chemistry disciplines were then evaluated and presented to highlight emerging use cases. Finally, the occurrence of different classes of substances and their roles in AI-related chemistry research were quantified, further detailing the popularity of AI adoption in the life sciences and analytical chemistry.

This drawback is critical when considering high‐resolution mass spectrometry data, which provide several thousand points for each considered pixel. In this work, different approaches have been tested to reduce the size of the analyzed data with the aim to allow the subsequent application of typical chemometric methods for image analysis. The standard approach for MSI data compression consists in binning mass spectra for each pixel to reduce the number of\n              m\n              /\n              z\n              values. In this work, a method is proposed to handle the huge size of MSI data based on the adaptation of a liquid chromatography‐mass spectrometry data compression method by the detection of regions of interest. Results showed that both approaches achieved high compression rates, although the proposed regions of interest–based method attains this reduction requiring lower computational requirements and keeping utter spectral information. For instance, typical compression rate reached values higher than 90% without loss of information in images and spectra.\n            \n          , \n            Application of chemometric methods to high‐resolution mass spectrometry images requires a preliminary compression of experimental data.

The review was written at a time when capillary column GC was still in its infancy. Commercial columns were (essentially) unavailable and sample introduction into capillary columns was done exclusively in the split mode. Two-dimensional separations were explored in only a few laboratories. The limitations of capillary column technology made this exercise rather difficult. The introduction of fused silica capillary columns in the early eighties drastically changed the landscape in which gas chromatography was practiced. It took the chromatographic community just a few years to convert from packed columns to capillary columns. Instrumentation and accessories specifically designed for capillary column use came onto the market. This writer had great hopes that the revolution in capillary column GC would be mirrored in the development of instrumentation for Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography. This never materialized. On the contrary, tentative steps taken by a few manufacturers and suppliers of chromatographic equipment fizzled out. It was perhaps the introduction of relatively inexpensive and user friendly GC/MS instrumentation, in combination with nearly indestructible fused silica capillary columns that took away the incentive to develop commercially viable Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography. Much of the thinking went like this: why insist on good chromatography if mass spectrometry can do the job without the need for complete separation. Some progress in the further development of conventional Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography has certainly been made over the last 20 years but there has not been a great deal of excitement. Applications have also been relatively sparse and they are limited to just a few areas. Science does not remain static and chromatography is no exception. Progress in gas chromatography is driven by new technology and ideas. Substantial improvements in two-dimensional GC were not forthcoming until Phillips and his research group introduced and implemented an entirely new form of Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography, called comprehensive two-dimensional GC, or GC×GC. This breakthrough occurred only in 1991 [2]. It does take some time before scientists change attitudes and habits. There is always a time lag between the introduction of new technology and its general acceptance. The public's attitude toward comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography is probably no exception. The number of scientists who are actively pursuing this new branch of gas chromatography is still very small. It is often a single individual who carries the torch. J.B. Phillips' name is synonymous with comprehensive Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography. He is not only its inventor and proponent but his fertile mind has initiated research in other related areas. Sadly, he passed away shortly before this review was written. This contribution is dedicated to his memory.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Bertsch","given":"Wolfgang"}],"citation-key":"bertsch1999","container-title":"Journal of High Resolution Chromatography","DOI":"10.1002/(SICI)1521-4168(19991201)22:12<647::AID-JHRC647>3.0.CO;2-V","ISSN":"1521-4168","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999"]]},"language":"en","page":"647-665","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Two-Dimensional Gas Chromatography.

The results, combined with chemometric analysis (linear discriminant analysis, LDA), were elaborated in order to classify Italian EVOO monocultivar samples. In accordance with the total and intrapositional fatty acid (FA) composition of TAG fraction, the results were allowed to carry out a varietal discrimination. In addition, volatile compounds were also determined by solid-phase micro-extraction gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis.

The spectra were collected in the range of near infrared (NIRS) and mid infrared (FTIR). For the data analysis, a SVM was built using radial basis as kernel function and the one-versus-all multiclass approach. The C and g parameters of SVM were optimized using the genetic algorithm. With the application of the NIRS-SVM approach all test samples were correctly classiﬁed with a sensitivity and speciﬁcity of 100%, while FTIR-SVM had a slightly lower performance. Therefore, it was possible to conﬁrm that infrared spectroscopy is a fast and effective method for geographic certiﬁcation with little sample preparation, and without the production of chemical wastes.

In recent years, rapid and reliable sensor, spectroscopic and chromatographic techniques have emerged that, together with multivariate and multiway chemometrics, have improved the whole control process by reducing the time of analysis and providing more informative results.

It applies especially to the parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC) model, but also to other models that can be considered as restricted Tucker3 models. It is based on scrutinizing the ‘appropriateness’ of the structural model based on the data and the estimated parameters of gradually augmented models. A PARAFAC model (employing dimension‐wise combinations of components for all modes) is called appropriate if adding other combinations of the same components does not improve the fit considerably. It is proposed to choose the largest model that is still sufficiently appropriate. Using examples from a range of different types of data, it is shown that the core consistency diagnostic is an effective tool for determining the appropriate number of components in e.g. PARAFAC models. However, it is also shown, using simulated data, that the theoretical understanding of CORCONDIA is not yet complete.

In Part I of this series an algorithm for PARAFAC2 was developed and extended to N-way arrays. It was discussed that the PARAFAC2 model has a number of attractive features. It is unique under mild conditions though it puts fewer restrictions on the data than the well-known PARAFAC1 model. This has important implications for the modeling of chromatographic data in which retention time shifts can be regarded as a violation of the assumption of parallel proportional proﬁles underlying the PARAFAC1 model. The PARAFAC2 model does not assume parallel proportional elution proﬁles, but only that the matrix of elution proﬁles preserve its ‘inner-product structure’ from sample to sample. This means that the cross-products of the matrix holding the elution proﬁles in its columns remain constant. Here an application using chromatographic separation based on the molecular size of thick juice samples from the beet sugar industry illustrates the beneﬁt of using the PARAFAC2 model.

PARAFAC is a generalization of PCA to higher order arrays, but some of the characteristics of the method are quite different from the ordinary two-way case. There is no rotation problem in PARAFAC, and e.g., pure spectra can be recovered from multi-way spectral data. One cannot as in PCA estimate components successively as this will give a model with poorer fit, than if the simultaneous solution is estimated. Finally scaling and centering is not as straightforward in the multi-way case as in the two-way case. An important advantage of using multi-way methods instead of unfolding methods is that the estimated models are very simple in a mathematical sense, and therefore more robust and easier to interpret. All these aspects plus more are explained in this tutorial and an implementation in Matlab code is available, that contains most of the features explained in the text. Three examples show how PARAFAC can be used for specific problems. The applications include subjects as: Analysis of variance by PARAFAC, a five-way application of PARAFAC, PARAFAC with half the elements missing, PARAFAC constrained to positive solutions and PARAFAC for regression as in principal component regression.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Bro","given":"Rasmus"}],"citation-key":"bro_PARAFACTutorialApplications_1997","container-title":"Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems","container-title-short":"Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems","DOI":"10.1016/S0169-7439(97)00032-4","ISSN":"0169-7439","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",10,1]]},"language":"en","page":"149-171","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"PARAFAC.

The flow rate limitations of MS detection require a compromise in the chromatographic flow rate, which in turn reduces throughput, and when using modern columns, a reduction in separation efficiency. Commonly, this restriction is combated through the post-column splitting of flow prior to entry into the mass spectrometer. However, this results in a loss of sensitivity and a loss in efficiency due to the post-extra column dead volume.\nMETHODS: A new chromatographic column format known as 'parallel segmented flow' involves the splitting of eluent flow within the column outlet end fitting, and in this study we present its application on a HPLC electrospray ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometer.\nRESULTS: Using parallel segmented flow, column flow rates as high as 2.5 mL/min were employed in the analysis of amino acids without post-column splitting to the mass spectrometer. Furthermore, when parallel segmented flow chromatography columns were employed, the sensitivity was more than twice that of conventional systems with post-column splitting when the same volume of mobile phase was passed through the detector.\nCONCLUSIONS: These finding suggest that this type of column technology will particularly enhance the capabilities of modern LC/MS enabling both high-throughput and sensitive mass spectral detection.

The process described herein illustrates how the principles of the infinite diameter column can be applied using conventional injection devices suitable for long-term analysis that requires robust protocols. Using this approach, sensitivity in separation was 2.5 times greater than conventional chromatography, yielding a product at twice the concentration.

This heterogeneity arises from the difference in packing density between the wall and central regions of the chromatographic bed and imparts radial variance in mobile phase velocity through the column. In conjunction with the uneven distribution of the sample band through frits and distributors at the head of the column, the resultant effect is a decrease in efficiency due to the formation of a parabolic-like sample band. We introduce the concept of Active Flow Management to counteract the effects of column heterogeneity via the separation of the flow eluting from the center of the column from that of the flow eluting near the peripheral wall region. The flow streams from the two aforementioned regions are separated by the use of a specialized column outlet fitting. By varying the ratio of flow eluting from the center to the peripheral region it was possible to increase the efficiency of a 100x21mm column by up to 57% compared to a column operated in the conventional manner.","archive_location":"WOS:000317267700007","author":[{"family":"Camenzuli","given":"M"},{"family":"Ritchie","given":"HJ"},{"family":"Ladine","given":"JR"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"camenzuli2013b","container-title":"JOURNAL OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES","DOI":"10.1080/10826076.2012.691438","ISSN":"1082-6076","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",4,1]]},"language":"English","page":"1379-1390","title":"ACTIVE FLOW MANAGEMENT IN CHROMATOGRAPHIC SEPARATIONS: A PRELIMINARY INVESTIGATION INTO ENHANCED PREPARATIVE SCALE SEPARATION USING A PARALLEL SEGMENTED OUTLET FLOW DISTRIBUTOR","type":"article-journal","volume":"36"},{"id":"camenzuli2013c","abstract":"Active flow technology is a new high performance liquid chromatography column format that has been shown to improve separation performance in terms of the sensitivity, resolution and number of theoretical plates.

Benefits from moderate alcohol consumption have been widely supported by the scientific literature and, in this line, red wine intake has been related to a lesser risk for coronary heart disease (CHD). Experimental studies and meta-analyses have mainly attributed this outcome to the presence in red wine of a great variety of polyphenolic compounds such as resveratrol, catechin, epicatechin, quercetin, and anthocyanin. Resveratrol is considered the most effective wine compound with respect to the prevention of CHD because of its antioxidant properties. The mechanisms responsible for its putative cardioprotective effects would include changes in lipid profiles, reduction of insulin resistance, and decrease in oxidative stress of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C). The aim of this review is to summarize the accumulated evidence correlating moderate red wine consumption with prevention of CHD by focusing on the different mechanisms underlying this relationship. Furthermore, the chemistry of wine as well as chemical factors that influence the composition of the bioactive components of red wine are also discussed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Castaldo","given":"Luigi"},{"family":"Narváez","given":"Alfonso"},{"family":"Izzo","given":"Luana"},{"family":"Graziani","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Gaspari","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Di Minno","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Ritieni","given":"Alberto"}],"citation-key":"castaldo_RedWineConsumption_2019","container-title":"Molecules","DOI":"10.3390/molecules24193626","ISSN":"1420-3049","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"19","page":"3626","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Red Wine Consumption and Cardiovascular Health","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/24/19/3626","volume":"24"},{"id":"castaneda_untargetedchromatographicmethods_2024","author":[{"family":"Castaneda","given":"Federico N."},{"family":"Vidal","given":"Rocio B.

The brewing process was carried out at two extraction temperatures (10 ± 0.5°C and 25 ± 0.5°C) and two particle sizes: medium (MG, 0.70–1.70 mm) and fine (FG, 0.43–0.71 mm). CBC brewing showed a complex relationship between brewing temperature and coffee grind particle size. The increase in brewing temperature enhanced the extraction rate. However, the particle size conditioned the extraction equilibrium time and final CBC properties. MG accelerated the brewing extrac­ tion rates to reach equilibrium in CBC properties (~7 h for 25ºC and ~12 h for 10ºC), while FG induced slower extraction rates and prolonged extraction times (above 12 h for both temperatures).

Their interface is unstable and a complex fingering pattern may arise. This phenomenon is important in chromatography because it may lead to a decrease or even a failure in separations. The onset of viscous fingering was visually observed by packing a glass column with particles having the same refractive index as the mobile phase and injecting plugs of dye solutions having viscosities different from that of the mobile phase. Severe fingering effects are observed if the viscosity difference exceeds 0.17 cP. However, for smaller viscosity differences, band distortions are observed that may affect retention data, band efficiency, and band resolution. Careful attention should be paid to matching the mobile phase viscosity and that of the injection plug when accurate chromatographic information is required. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, a rapid and sensitive analytical technique was used for detailed phenolics fingerprinting of 42 Macedonian red wines produced from different wine regions. Analyses were performed using high performance liquid chromatography in combination with low-field drift tube ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry (HPLC×IMS-TOFMS). The reliability of DTCCSN2 values, based on consensus values from a standardized and reproducible workflow, was evaluated as an identification point for wine metabolomics. Using appropriate software tools for alignment and statistical evaluation, a full dataset for each wine was obtained, including retention time, accurate mass, fragment spectra and DTCCSN2. Putative compounds were further assessed by assignment of in-source and post-drift mass fragments aligned according to retention time, drift time, and accurate mass. Up to seven identification points for a single compound can be generated when data from both positive and negative mode measurements are combined. The correlation between abundance across the two ionization modes was found to be very good in many examples with correlation coefficients (R2) values of 0.63-0.97 for eleven putative metabolites in Vranec wines, and 0.70-0.99 for nine putative metabolites in Pinot Noir.\nAcknowledgments: The Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of Macedonia and the Austrian Agency for International Cooperation in Education and Research (OeAD) are thanked for financial support (Bilateral Project between Austria and R.

The method combines chromatographic separation, constituent analysis, and post-column identiﬁcation of antioxidants in plant extracts. The separation of polyphenols was performed on a C18 column using gradient elution with two different mobile phase solutions, i.e., MeOH and 0.2% o-phosphoric acid. The HPLC-separated antioxidant polyphenols in the extracts react with copper(II)neocuproine (Cu(II)-Nc) reagent in a post-column reaction coil to form a derivative. The reagent is reduced by antioxidants to the copper(I)-neocuproine (Cu(I)-Nc) chelate having maximum absorption at 450 nm. The negative peaks of antioxidant constituents were monitored by measuring the increase in absorbance due to Cu(I)-Nc. The detection limits of polyphenols at 450 nm (in the range of 0.17–3.46 ␮M) after post-column derivatization were comparable to those at 280 nm UV detection without derivatization. The developed method was successfully applied to the identiﬁcation of antioxidant compounds in crude extracts of Camellia sinensis, Origanum marjorana and Mentha. The method is rapid, inexpensive, versatile, non-laborious, uses stable reagents, and enables the on-line qualitative and quantitative estimation of antioxidant constituents of complex plant samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Çelik","given":"Saliha Esin"},{"family":"Özyürek","given":"Mustafa"},{"family":"Güçlü","given":"Kubilay"},{"family":"Apak","given":"Reşat"}],"citation-key":"çelik_Determinationantioxidantsnovel_2010","container-title":"Analytica Chimica Acta","container-title-short":"Analytica Chimica Acta","DOI":"10.1016/j.aca.2010.06.013","ISSN":"00032670","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7]]},"language":"en","page":"79-88","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Determination of antioxidants by a novel on-line HPLC-cupric reducing antioxidant capacity (CUPRAC) assay with post-column detection","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0003267010007518","volume":"674"},{"id":"centerforscienceinthepublic-CaffeineChart-2022","abstract":"Caffeine is one of the only FDA-approved drugs that is present naturally and legally added to widely consumed foods.

In this paper, we describe a scalable endto-end tree boosting system called XGBoost, which is used widely by data scientists to achieve state-of-the-art results on many machine learning challenges. We propose a novel sparsity-aware algorithm for sparse data and weighted quantile sketch for approximate tree learning. More importantly, we provide insights on cache access patterns, data compression and sharding to build a scalable tree boosting system. By combining these insights, XGBoost scales beyond billions of examples using far fewer resources than existing systems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Chen","given":"Tianqi"},{"family":"Guestrin","given":"Carlos"}],"citation-key":"chen_2016","container-title":"Proceedings of the 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","DOI":"10.1145/2939672.2939785","event-place":"San Francisco California USA","event-title":"KDD '16: The 22nd ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining","ISBN":"978-1-4503-4232-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,13]]},"language":"en","page":"785-794","publisher":"ACM","publisher-place":"San Francisco California USA","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"XGBoost: A Scalable Tree Boosting System","title-short":"XGBoost","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/2939672.2939785"},{"id":"cheng_Anthocyanincharacteristicswines_2017","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,19]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Guo"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Si-Hong"},{"family":"Wen","given":"Ren-De"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Tai-Li"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Yu"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Ying"},{"family":"Guan","given":"Jing-Xi"},{"family":"Xie","given":"Lin-Jun"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Jin"}],"citation-key":"cheng_Anthocyanincharacteristicswines_2017","container-title":"Food Science and Technology","container-title-short":"Food Sci.

In this contribution, we propose to incorporate semi-algebraic approaches for the computation of PARAFAC in the DF algorithm and explore how it should be adapted to largely exploit the resulting diversity in the estimates of factor matrices to enhance the robustness and efficiency. Three versions have been tailored and recommended for different parameter settings according to, e.g., the number of components or tensor dimensions. Extensive numerical simulations have been conducted with both synthetic and measured biomedical as well as wine data to validate the improved performance of the proposed DF algorithms. In addition, it has been shown that applying the geometric search on top of the proposed DF algorithms further boosts their performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Cheng","given":"Yao"},{"family":"Haardt","given":"Martin"}],"citation-key":"cheng_enhanceddirectfitting_2019","container-title":"IEEE Signal Processing Letters","DOI":"10.1109/LSP.2019.2897244","ISSN":"1558-2361","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4]]},"page":"533-537","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Enhanced Direct Fitting Algorithms for PARAFAC2 With Algebraic Ingredients","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8633438/?arnumber=8633438","volume":"26"},{"id":"chin2014","archive_location":"WOS:000339861700001","author":[{"family":"Chin","given":"ST"},{"family":"Marriott","given":"PJ"}],"citation-key":"chin2014","container-title":"CHEMICAL COMMUNICATIONS","DOI":"10.1039/c4cc02018a","ISSN":"1359-7345","issue":"64","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",8,18]]},"page":"8819-8833","title":"Multidimensional gas chromatography beyond simple volatiles separation","type":"article-journal","volume":"50"},{"id":"christoph_25Yearsauthentication_2015","author":[{"family":"Christoph","given":"Norbert"},{"family":"Hermann","given":"Armin"},{"family":"Wachter","given":"Helmut"}],"citation-key":"christoph_25Yearsauthentication_2015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"title":"25 Years authentication of wine with stable isotope analysis in the European Union – Review and outlook","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://api.semanticscholar.org/CorpusID:55324702"},{"id":"chure_2023","abstract":"High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Gas Chromatography are analytical techniques which allow for the quantitative characterization of the chemical components of mixtures . Technological advancements in sample preparation and mechanical automation have allowed HPLC to become a high-throughput tool which poses new challenges for reproducible and rapid analysis of the resulting chromatograms. Here we present hplc-py, a Python package that permits rapid and reliable quantitation of component signals within a chromatogram for pipelined workflows. This is achieved by a signal detection and quantitation algorithm which i) identifies windows of time which contain peaks and ii) infers the parameters of a mixture of amplitude-weighted skew-normal distributions which sum to reconstruct the observed signal. This approach is particularly effective at deconvolving highly overlapping signals, allowing for precise absolute quantitation of chemical constituents with similar chromatographic retention times.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",11,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Chure","given":"Griffin"},{"family":"Cremer","given":"Jonas"}],"citation-key":"chure_2023","DOI":"10.26434/chemrxiv-2023-m2n4r","genre":"preprint","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,9]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Chemistry","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"hplc-py: A Python Package For Rapid Peak Quantification in Complex Chromatograms","title-short":"hplc-py","type":"report","URL":"https://chemrxiv.org/engage/chemrxiv/article-details/6520405345aaa5fdbb709f2f"},{"id":"chure_hplcpyautomatedpeak_2023","abstract":"Welcome to the documentation for hplc-py!

However, little is known about the effect of variation in temperature on the NIR spectrum of wine and the subsequent effect on the performance of calibrations used to measure chemical composition. Several parameters influence the spectra of organic molecules in the NIR region, with temperature being one of the most important factors affecting the vibration intensity and frequency of molecular bonds. Wine is a complex mixture of chemical components (e.g. water, sugars, organic acids, and ethanol), and a simple ethanol and water model solution cannot be used to study the possible effects of temperature variations in the NIR spectrum of wine. Ten red and 10 white wines were scanned in triplicate at six different temperatures (25 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 35 degrees C, 40 degrees C, 45 degrees C and 50 degrees C) in the visible (vis) and NIR regions (400-2500 nm) in a monochromator instrument in transmission mode (1 mm path length). Principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares (PLS) regression models were developed using full cross validation (leave-one-out). These models were used to interpret the spectra and to develop calibrations for alcohol, sugars (glucose+fructose) and pH at different temperatures. The results showed that differences in the spectra around 970 nm and 1400 nm, related to O-H bonding were observed for both varieties. Additionally an effect of temperature on the vis region of red wine spectra was observed. The standard error of cross validation (SECV) achieved for the PLS calibration models tended to inverse as the temperature increased. The practical implication of this study it is recommended that the temperature of scanning for wine analysis using a 1 mm path length cuvette should be between 30 degrees C and 35 degrees C.","author":[{"family":"Cozzolino","given":"D."},{"family":"Liu","given":"L."},{"family":"Cynkar","given":"W.

Nevertheless, dating the obtained results cannot be compared as they are based on data acquired by a particular analytical instrument, thus they are instrument-dependant. Therefore, this creates difficulties in generating a database large enough to gather together all the variability of the samples. The solution to this problem is to obtain an instrument-agnostic chromatographic signal that is independent of the chromatographic state, i.e., measuring instrument or particular condition of the same instrument from which it was acquired. This paper describes the methodology to be followed to obtain standardized instrumental fingerprints when liquid chromatography is used for prior separation. For this purpose both internal and external chemical standards series are used as references. As an application example, we have applied this methodology for the determination of biophenols in olive oil by liquid chromatography coupled to ultraviolet-visible detector (LC-UV), using three different LC-UV instruments. The instrument-agnostic fingerprints obtained show a high grade of similarity, regardless of the state of the chromatographic system or the time of acquisition.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Cuadros-Rodríguez","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Martín-Torres","given":"Sandra"},{"family":"Ortega-Gavilán","given":"Fidel"},{"family":"Jiménez-Carvelo","given":"Ana M."},{"family":"López-Ruiz","given":"Rosalía"},{"family":"Garrido-Frenich","given":"Antonia"},{"family":"Bagur-González","given":"M.

Mathematical processing of the information in such fingerprints may allow the characterisation and/or authentication of foodstuffs. In this context, the particular meaning of 'fingerprinting', in conjunction with 'profiling', is different from the original meanings used in metabolomics. This fact has produced some confusion with the use of these terms in analytical papers. Researchers coming from the metabolomic field could use 'profiling' or 'fingerprinting' on a different way to researchers who are devoted to food science. The arrival of an eclectic discipline, named 'foodomics' has not been enough to allay this terminological problem, since the authors keep on using the terms with both meanings. Thus, a first goal of this tutorial is to clarify the difference between both terms. In addition, the chemical approaches for food authentication, i.e., chemical markers, component profiling and instrumental fingerprinting, have been described. A new term, designated as 'food identitation', has been introduced in order to complete the life cycle of the chemical-based food authentication process. Chromatographic fingerprinting has been explained in detail and some strategies which could be applied has been clarified and discussed. Particularly, the strategies for chromatographic signals acquisition and chromatographic data handling are unified in a single framework. Finally, an overview about the applications of chromatographic (GC and LC) fingerprints in food authentication using different chemometric techniques has been included.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Cuadros-Rodríguez","given":"Luis"},{"family":"Ruiz-Samblás","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Valverde-Som","given":"Lucia"},{"family":"Pérez-Castaño","given":"Estefanía"},{"family":"González-Casado","given":"Antonio"}],"citation-key":"cuadros-rodriguez_ChromatographicFingerprintingInnovative_2016","container-title":"Analytica Chimica Acta","container-title-short":"Analytica Chimica Acta","DOI":"10.1016/j.aca.2015.12.042","ISSN":"0003-2670","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",2,25]]},"language":"en","page":"9-23","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Chromatographic fingerprinting: An innovative approach for food 'identitation' and food authentication – A tutorial","title-short":"Chromatographic fingerprinting","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267016300204","volume":"909"},{"id":"cubero-leon_metabolomicsorganicfood_2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Cubero-Leon","given":"Elena"},{"family":"De Rudder","given":"Olivier"},{"family":"Maquet","given":"Alain"}],"citation-key":"cubero-leon_metabolomicsorganicfood_2018","container-title":"Food Chemistry","container-title-short":"Food Chemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2017.06.161","ISSN":"03088146","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1]]},"language":"en","page":"760-770","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Metabolomics for organic food authentication: Results from a long-term field study in carrots","title-short":"Metabolomics for organic food authentication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0308814617311433","volume":"239"},{"id":"cubero-leon_reviewmetabolomicsfood_2014","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Cubero-Leon","given":"Elena"},{"family":"Peñalver","given":"Rosa"},{"family":"Maquet","given":"Alain"}],"citation-key":"cubero-leon_reviewmetabolomicsfood_2014","container-title":"Food Research International","container-title-short":"Food Research International","DOI":"10.1016/j.foodres.2013.11.041","ISSN":"09639969","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",6]]},"language":"en","page":"95-107","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Review on metabolomics for food authentication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0963996913006509","volume":"60"},{"id":"cuzuel2018","archive_location":"WOS:000425074200008","author":[{"family":"Cuzuel","given":"V"},{"family":"Sizun","given":"A"},{"family":"Cognon","given":"G"},{"family":"Rivals","given":"I"},{"family":"Heulard","given":"F"},{"family":"Thiebaut","given":"D"},{"family":"Vial","given":"J"}],"citation-key":"cuzuel2018","container-title":"JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2017.08.060","ISSN":"0021-9673","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",2,9]]},"page":"58-66","title":"Human odor and forensics.

The strategy combines the wines’ functionality, designed as antioxidant activity (DPPH and ORAC), total polyphenols (TP), total anthocyanins (TA), and color, with a data mining technique known as support vector machines (SVM). The original dataset has 16 wine samples from Brazil and 113 from Chile. Algorithms were used to balance the dataset. Using resampling algorithms, we extended the Brazilian wines to 32 samples and reduced the Chilean wines to 32. With the proposed methodology, it was possible to classify the origin of the wine with an accuracy of 89% when using the 20 original elements. An accuracy of 83% was found using only 5 elements (L, DPPH, delph-3-acetylglu, peon-3-(coum)glu, and pet-3-acetylglu). Our methodology can be used for origin certification of other wines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Costa","given":"Nattane Luiza","non-dropping-particle":"da"},{"family":"Castro","given":"Inar Alves"},{"family":"Barbosa","given":"Rommel"}],"citation-key":"dacosta-ClassificationCabernetSauvignon-2016","container-title":"Applied Artificial Intelligence","container-title-short":"Applied Artificial Intelligence","DOI":"10.1080/08839514.2016.1214416","ISSN":"0883-9514, 1087-6545","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",8,8]]},"language":"en","page":"679-689","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Classification of Cabernet Sauvignon from Two Different Countries in South America by Chemical Compounds and Support Vector Machines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08839514.2016.1214416","volume":"30"},{"id":"danaher_","author":[{"family":"Danaher","given":"Damian"},{"family":"Newman","given":"Zahra"},{"family":"Shino","given":"Taka"},{"family":"Yallop","given":"Amanda"}],"citation-key":"danaher_","language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Jeremy Croft Head Sommelier","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"danezis-FoodAuthenticationTechniques-2016","abstract":"Food authentication is a rapidly growing ﬁeld due to increasing public awareness concerning food quality and safety.

Many analytical results, including chromatograms, are essentially presented as images, often to convey qualitative information. Power transformations have remarkable effects on the appearance of the image, in chromatography, for example, increasing apparent resolution between peaks by the factor root n and apparent column efficiency (plate counts) by a factor of n for an nth-power transform. The profile of a Gaussian peak is not qualitatively changed, but the peak becomes narrower, whereas for an exponentially tailing peak, asymmetry at the 10% peak height level changes markedly. Using several examples we show that power transforms also increase signal-to-noise ratio and make it easier to discern an event of detection. However, they may not improve the limit of detection. Power responses are intrinsic to some detection schemes, and in others they are imbedded in instrument firmware to increase apparent linear range that the casual user may not be aware of. The consequences are demonstrated and discussed.","archive_location":"WOS:000285215800026","author":[{"family":"Dasgupta","given":"PK"},{"family":"Chen","given":"YJ"},{"family":"Serrano","given":"CA"},{"family":"Guiochon","given":"G"},{"family":"Liu","given":"HH"},{"family":"Fairchild","given":"JN"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"dasgupta2010","container-title":"ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","DOI":"10.1021/ac102242t","ISSN":"0003-2700","issue":"24","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",12,15]]},"language":"English","page":"10143-10150","title":"Black Box Linearization for Greater Linear Dynamic Range: The Effect of Power Transforms on the Representation of Data","type":"article-journal","volume":"82"},{"id":"datamentor-FactorsFactorLevels-2017","abstract":"In this article, you will learn to work with factors in R programming; a data structure used for predefined, finite number of values.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,24]]},"author":[{"family":"DataMentor","given":""}],"citation-key":"datamentor-FactorsFactorLevels-2017","container-title":"DataMentor","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",11,23]]},"language":"en-US","section":"R Programming","title":"R Factors and Factor Levels (With Examples)","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://www.datamentor.io/r-programming/factor/"},{"id":"datamites2020","abstract":"Python Pandas Tips and Tricks.\nLoading multiple files into DataFrame\nhttps://in.linkedin.com/in/ashokveda\n\nCODE: https://github.com/ashokveda/pandas_t...\n\nOther Python Pandas videos\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YLg4v...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=773zr...\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=773zr...\n\nDataMites is a leading training institute for data science courses in INDIA.

The resulting theory describes overlap in unsaturated separations, for which the variation of SCP density throughout the separation is known. The expected number of peaks is expressed by an integral, whose value depends on the average saturation of the separation, the number of detectable components, and a frequently function proportional to the SCP density. The theory is verified by its application to computer-simulated chromatograms containing SCPs with linear, quadratic, sinusoidal, and exponential frequencies. Procedures are proposed to estimate the frequency function from the distribution of chromatographic maxima and to estimate the number of detectable components in chromatograms. These procedures are verified by their application to computer-simulated chromatograms and to an experimental chromatogram of a well-characterized mixture. Computer simulations show that these procedures are more robust than those based on a constant Poisson density. A mathematical proof is offered, which shows that at constant low average saturation the maximum number of peaks in a separation containing SCPs with variable Poisson densities is obtained, when the SCP density is constant. This proof may explain previous experimental observations.","author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"Joe M."}],"citation-key":"davis1994","container-title":"Analytical chemistry (Washington)","DOI":"10.1021/ac00077a025","event-place":"Washington, DC","ISSN":"0003-2700","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["1994"]]},"language":"eng","page":"735–746","publisher":"American Chemical Society","publisher-place":"Washington, DC","source":"west-sydney-primo.com","title":"Statistical Theory of Overlap for Variable Poisson Density: Relaxation of Constraint of Randomness","title-short":"Statistical Theory of Overlap for Variable Poisson Density","type":"article-journal","volume":"66"},{"id":"davis2008","archive_location":"WOS:000252318200014","author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"JM"},{"family":"Stoll","given":"DR"},{"family":"Carr","given":"PW"}],"citation-key":"davis2008","container-title":"ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","DOI":"10.1021/ac071504j","ISSN":"0003-2700","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",1,15]]},"page":"461-473","title":"Effect of first-dimension undersampling on effective peak capacity in comprehensive two-dimensional separations","type":"article-journal","volume":"80"},{"id":"davis2008a","archive_location":"WOS:000260567000033","author":[{"family":"Davis","given":"JM"},{"family":"Stoll","given":"DR"},{"family":"Carr","given":"PW"}],"citation-key":"davis2008a","container-title":"ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","DOI":"10.1021/ac800933z","ISSN":"0003-2700","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",11,1]]},"page":"8122-8134","title":"Dependence of Effective Peak Capacity in Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Separations on the Distribution of Peak Capacity between the Two Dimensions","type":"article-journal","volume":"80"},{"id":"dawson-jones-ReferencingCopyright-2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Dawson-Jones","given":"Leontyne"},{"family":"Worthington","given":"Lisa"}],"citation-key":"dawson-jones-ReferencingCopyright-2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"title":"Referencing and Copyright","type":"speech","URL":"https://learn-ap-southeast-2-prod-fleet01-xythos.content.blackboardcdn.com/5df059da37b55/10272346?X-Blackboard-Expiration=1645552800000&X-Blackboard-Signature=q75o5%2Fekw8K8q46F9B1qxvtc9r8vrYf%2FFp1bLNq4TiE%3D&X-Blackboard-Client-Id=100287&response-cache-control=private%2C%20max-age%3D21600&response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%2A%3DUTF-8%27%272020.GRS.referencing_and%2520_copyright.HDR.presentation.pdf&response-content-type=application%2Fpdf&X-Amz-Security-Token=IQoJb3JpZ2luX2VjEAUaDmFwLXNvdXRoZWFzdC0yIkYwRAIgd5B6AmMc3g1WhJIXNLFORRSiv2ZluxQZCkBKdw3LUDgCIDR4qksr16RVq0E9jgOhzBHpsRVNquDVd%2Bax5pTGtwcIKoQECF4QABoMNTU2OTAzODYxMzYxIgydYNDDQKjjZRxZ4yYq4QPOR2G1sKAIHZLI6x96CmfDb4HdqAR9iGx%2FQxt4t41RgCEvIbNL77%2B5hJSDoQ9A3h20wVQwrTAeO2ie2kuFlXZf1i9J5Utr1XcMQN7m5ETiZZlowQobNm9qZqRpGSufI%2BBI%2FyQLsTSpUv%2B3cOyaKcQTpdRU89m5wb%2FPLqMPOeq6IdUFKKIZn%2B7YObSARhxBiW8%2B%2Fru76jE6odroT%2B%2BDy5nTgc9n6rU9J4curALUvBN9UUsGgZm80Qytd9wpBMHDP782YhEtD8EUswBdmYJJR0KAQt%2FyhdhggwUrXEigPezucS3KXFP2Nkr92jLalMKH6xfyTiZt%2FFZ02%2BfgTQ1X00%2F65bZ%2FvDBmtoj6Iwjl9M0BiERhhBwVF0C5fLzcuFgO5oMurp9iMr3V0iiHQdBa%2F7wup8cYoE%2BLfzxXNwnqVcsZf8aRKykC0MvUa0DZPt%2BJ6AjGy2gOMe9%2FbgVXLTeayl7rI00%2BeOHTsOEDUSvVAXI%2B5gQS%2FkbMsUVrkewIvmfBFa0olpFMVDLg3FO9Gf%2FMnn7fYPpiUf%2BJ5O81qQ5C9gTL6fXOt42e%2BngJKsUfdLu2t0h420IH%2FEqjTwcKAK2%2BdtEcLjRtB3q9uiySYUKH3%2FORHKND2U8frDPaKc1O5hXvW3p4MI2%2B05AGOqYBy42swe32GvRbHllZv6q%2Bn%2Fqg0NGKOFYt%2FK40JzKFgij0CmG4d38Q4Y2jSd%2BjgcZga16RfZsiScGMbXMQpYgQ%2BlRITecACrJ4uuk4OsanBxjDzZVp%2Bfhz7twZvOnZrtj7tqWAbbEmCFhb3VXcQRNvo9tamFeFwXDS%2FVkjnSav7b64qGamocYDZWw6nkElUvBSIgjfyJqSN1BS1jCSdLhDqe6OevvO0g%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20220222T120000Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=21600&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAYDKQORRY3RLLUGQ5%2F20220222%2Fap-southeast-2%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=0c9273761bc3ae442fd6789c75f16c58f9a2c951a96c80eaeea7fc19e781ba41"},{"id":"day-StatisticsSquareOne-2003","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Day","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"day-StatisticsSquareOne-2003","container-title":"Pharmaceutical Statistics","DOI":"10.1002/pst.56","ISSN":"1539-1612","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003"]]},"language":"en","page":"152-153","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Statistics at Square One, Tenth Edition.

Therefore, Nescafé Dolce Gusto espresso coffee capsules were chosen in order to understand the polypropylene stabilization and degradation initiators with the purpose of recycling by applying in a composite material, as home composting product. In this context, the plastic capsule wastes were exposed to chemical, thermal, accelerated weathering (ultraviolet radiation + humidity) and natural weathering in order to analyze the influence of exposure and possibilities of a real application in a composting environment. Masses of the samples were monitored before and during the weathering conditions. Thermal (TGA and DSC) and chemical (FTIR) analysis were carried out before and after exposure. No changes in thermal stability were observed, however, samples conditioned in acid solution presented thermal degradation event beginning at 131 °C. In addition, all samples presented a similar behavior of melting and crystallization points, which did not change with exposure. FTIR analysis showed a disappearance of CC and CO bonds on samples exposed to natural weathering and basic solution conditioning. It also showed formation of chromophores groups on samples exposed to accelerated weathering. The visual analysis showed huge differences in samples exposed to accelerated weathering and acid solution, which were the most damaged. On the other hand, samples exposed to natural weathering, thermal and basic conditioning did not presented significantly changes supported by the TGA and FTIR results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Bomfim","given":"Anne Shayene Campos","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Maciel","given":"Maísa Milanez Ávila Dias"},{"family":"Voorwald","given":"Herman Jacobus Cornelis"},{"family":"Benini","given":"Kelly Cristina Coelho de Carvalho"},{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Daniel Magalhães","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Cioffi","given":"Maria Odila Hilário"}],"citation-key":"debomfim-EffectDifferentDegradation-2019","container-title":"Waste Management","container-title-short":"Waste Management","DOI":"10.1016/j.wasman.2018.11.006","ISSN":"0956-053X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"123-130","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Effect of different degradation types on properties of plastic waste obtained from espresso coffee capsules","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X18306718","volume":"83"},{"id":"defigueiredotavares-CoffeeBeveragePreparation-2020","abstract":"Purpose Coffee is among the most appreciated beverages in the world, and there is a wide variety of methods of coffee consumption, inside and outside the home, with a significant growth in the coffee machine market for single serve. Due to this significant growth and in agreement with the current sustainability directives, the objective of the present article was to evaluate the environmental performance of the preparation step of the most representative methods of beverage preparation.\nMethods The principles of the life cycle assessment (LCA) were applied to evaluate the environmental efficiency of the beverage preparation stage for the following methods: the traditional espresso, the French Press, the AeroPress, filtered coffee systems in coffee shops, the homemade filtration, and single-serve automatic machines. The boundaries of the study included the agricultural stage, the industrial roasting/grinding, and the beverage preparation up to final disposal of waste. Data were collected from 40 establishments among coffee shops, bakeries, and homes, with 153 individual data. The environmental efficiency was measured regarding energy, water consumption, waste generation, and the environmental impacts scores related to global warming, eutrophication, acidification, abiotic depletion, and human toxicity calculated by CML 2001 method.\nResults and discussion Individualized data of coffee roasting/grinding from the industrial process was provided. The preparation of a single-serve soft pod (paper sachet) using an automatic machine resulted in the lowest emission of 14.3 g of CO2 eq/50 mL of beverage in the monodose category, and also a non-biodegradable packaging waste to landfills about 11 times less than the singleserve plastic capsules with aluminum top seal, which had the highest consumption of energy, water, and waste generation in the single-serve category. In the category of consumption outside the home, espresso coffee, produced under pressure and higher temperatures, had the greatest impact, mainly due to its concentration, and the energy demanded by the automatic machines.\nConclusions The study identified that the concentration of coffee, as well as the ratio of packaging mass per volume of beverage prepared, has a significant effect on the calculated environmental impacts. The single-serve pods method using paper sachets can associate convenience with low environmental impact. The results obtained allow the consumer to include the environmental aspects in the choice of method for beverage preparation and also provide relevant information for public policy concerning residue generation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Figueiredo Tavares","given":"Maria Paula","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Mourad","given":"Anna Lúcia"}],"citation-key":"defigueiredotavares-CoffeeBeveragePreparation-2020","container-title":"The International Journal of Life Cycle Assessment","container-title-short":"Int J Life Cycle Assess","DOI":"10.1007/s11367-019-01719-2","ISSN":"0948-3349, 1614-7502","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",7]]},"language":"en","page":"1356-1367","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Coffee beverage preparation by different methods from an environmental perspective","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11367-019-01719-2","volume":"25"},{"id":"dehaan2021","abstract":"There is an increasing need for research chemists and biochemists to have a basic familiarity with computer programming.

Here, we describe incorporating Python programming, using Jupyter notebooks, into a lower division analytical chemistry course in support of the existing learning outcomes of the course. By linking lab experiments with speciﬁc course learning outcomes, quantitative topics, and computer programming concepts, we have created a series of analytical chemistry lab modules that introduce students to Python coding without losing any of the traditional content of the course. Additionally, we show that this curriculum can be successfully implemented by faculty with limited coding experience. Assessment indicates that the Python-enhanced course makes students more positive about the applicability of quantitative skills in many areas, and increases their self-perception of their level of preparation for future careers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,19]]},"author":[{"family":"De Haan","given":"David O."},{"family":"Schafer","given":"Julia A."},{"family":"Gillette","given":"Eleanor I."}],"citation-key":"dehaan2021","container-title":"Journal of Chemical Education","container-title-short":"J.

The ﬁrst group of methods provides unique solutions, whereas the second group gives solutions subject to rotational ambiguities. DTD and PARAFAC are thus the choice to deal with chemical data sets with trilinear structure. However, in the analysis of chemical data with non-trilinear structure, which is most commonly found in practice, the more ambiguous solutions given by TUCKER3 and MCR–ALS could be balanced by the major ﬂexibility in the modelling of proﬁles. To assess this possibility, three-way resolution methods from the two mentioned families are applied to simulated and real data sets designed to show typical non-trilinear chemical situations, caused by shifts and shape changes in proﬁles.

These theoretical parameters were then compared to their experimental counterparts, which were known for the synthetic mixture. Excellent agreement between experiment and theory was found at low chromatographic saturations. This agreement affirms earlier predictions based on this model and supports the argument that peak overlap can be addressed in some instances by theoretical means. At higher saturations, systematic departures of experiment from theory were found.

The current study aimed at investigating the antioxidant activity, in relation to the phytochemical composition, of authenticated Brazilian green and roasted Coffea arabica and C. robusta, along with 15 commercial specimens collected from the Middle East. Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (UHPLC-ESI–HRMS) and UV spectrometry were employed for profiling and fingerprinting, respectively. With the aid of global natural product social molecular networking (GNPS), a total of 88 peaks were annotated as belonging to different chemical classes, of which 11 metabolites are reported for the first time in coffee seeds. Moreover, chemometric tools showed comparable results between both platforms, with more advantages for UV in the annotation of roasting products, suggesting that UV can serve as a discriminative tool. Additionally, antioxidant assays coupled with the UHPLC-ESI–HRMS dataset using partial least-squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) demonstrated that caffeoylquinic acid and caffeine were potential antioxidant markers in unroasted coffee versus dicaffeoyl quinolactone and melanoidins in roasted coffee.

It is suspected the reasons for these effects are solvent strength mismatch and/or viscosity mismatch. This study presents a systematic and fundamental investigation of the origin of these peak deformations due to the injection solvent effects in SFC, using both systematic experiments and numerical modeling. The first set of experiments proved that the injection volume and the elution strength of the sample solution had a major impact of the shapes of the eluted peaks. Secondly, the sample band elution profile was numerically modeled on a theoretical basis assuming both un-retained and retained co-solvent injection plugs, respectively. These calculations quantitatively confirmed our first set of experiments but also pointed out that there is also an additional significant effect. Third, viscous fingering experiments were performed using viscosity contrast conditions imitating those encountered in SFC. These experiments clearly proved that viscous fingering effects play a significant role. A new method for determination of adsorption isotherms of solvents was also developed, called the \"Retention Time Peak Method\" (RTPM). The RTPM was used for fast estimation of the adsorption isotherms of the modifier and required using only two experiments. © 2015 Elsevier

review discusses recent advances in both theory and experiment regarding multi-way chromatographic calibration. The focus is directed towards the chemometric processing of multi-way data arrays in which one or more instrumental modes describe the elution time behavior across liquid or gas chromatographic columns, and the remaining ones are of spectroscopic nature, e.g. UV-vis absorption, fluorescence emission (either as vectors or matrices) or mass spectrometry. Successful multi-way data decomposition into profiles for the contributing components allows one to perform quantitative analysis of complex samples. Quantitative applications usually make appropriate use of the second-order advantage which is inherent to multi-way data processing, and reduce the complexity of the data to a virtual univariate calibration which is typical of classical analytical chemistry. A number of recent experimental works will be discussed to illustrate the above concepts. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Food adulteration is occurring increasingly often today. With globalization and complex distribution systems, adulteration may have a far-reaching impact and even adverse consequences on well-being. The means of the international community to confront and solve food fraud today are scattered and largely ineffective. A collective approach is needed to identify all stakeholders in the food supply chain, certify and qualify them, exclude those failing to meet applicable standards, and track food in a real time. This review provides some background into the drivers of fraudulent practices (economically motivated adulteration, food-industry perspectives, and consumers’ perceptions of fraud) and discusses a wide range of the currently available technologies for detecting food adulteration followed by multivariate pattern recognition tools. Food chain integrity policies are discussed. Future directions in research, concerned not only with food adulterers but also with food safety and climate change, may be useful for researchers in developing interdisciplinary approaches to contemporary problems.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Esteki","given":"M."},{"family":"Regueiro","given":"J."},{"family":"Simal-Gándara","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"esteki2019a","container-title":"Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety","DOI":"10.1111/1541-4337.12419","ISSN":"1541-4337","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"425-440","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Tackling Fraudsters with Global Strategies to Expose Fraud in the Food Chain","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1541-4337.12419","volume":"18"},{"id":"ethanbass_2023","abstract":"chromatographR","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,16]]},"author":[{"literal":"Ethan Bass"}],"citation-key":"ethanbass_2023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","title":"chromatographR","type":"webpage","URL":"https://ethanbass.github.io/chromatographR/articles/chromatographR.html"},{"id":"europeancommission.directorategeneralforresearchandinnovation.2018","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,17]]},"author":[{"literal":"European Commission.

Over 80 compounds were tested. Compound classes included phenols, thiols, vitamins, amino acids, proteins, nucleotide bases, unsaturated fatty acids, carbohydrates, organic acids, inorganic ions, metal complexes, aldehydes and ketones. All phenols, proteins and thiols tested were reactive towards the reagent. Many vitamin derivatives were also reactive, as were the inorganic ions Fe+2, Mn+2, I− and SO3−2. Other compounds showing reactivity included the nucleotide base guanine and the trioses glyceraldehyde and dihydroxyacetone. Copper complexation enhanced the reactivity of salicylate derivatives towards the reagent while zinc complexation did not. Several amino acids and sugars which were reported to be reactive towards the F-C reagent in earlier studies were found not to be reactive in our study, at least in the concentrations used., Reaction kinetics of each compound with the F-C reagent were also measured. Most compounds tested showed a biphasic kinetic pattern with half lives under one minute. Trolox and ascorbic acid displayed a rapid monophasic pattern in which the reaction reached endpoint within one minute., In summary, our study has shown that the F-C reagent is significantly reactive towards other compounds besides phenols. As other investigators have suggested, the F-C assay should be seen as a measure of total antioxidant capacity rather than phenolic content. Since phenolics are the most abundant antioxidants in most plants, it gives a rough approximation of total phenolic content in most cases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Everette","given":"Jace D."},{"family":"Bryant","given":"Quinton M."},{"family":"Green","given":"Ashlee M."},{"family":"Abbey","given":"Yvonne A."},{"family":"Wangila","given":"Grant W."},{"family":"Walker","given":"Richard B."}],"citation-key":"everette_2010","container-title":"Journal of agricultural and food chemistry","container-title-short":"J Agric Food Chem","DOI":"10.1021/jf1005935","ISSN":"0021-8561","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,28]]},"page":"8139-8144","PMCID":"PMC4075968","PMID":"20583841","source":"PubMed Central","title":"A THOROUGH STUDY OF REACTIVITY OF VARIOUS COMPOUND CLASSES TOWARDS THE FOLIN-CIOCALTEU REAGENT","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4075968/","volume":"58"},{"id":"everitt_cambridgedictionarystatistics_2010","author":[{"family":"Everitt","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Skrondal","given":"Anders"}],"call-number":"QA276.14 .E84 2010","citation-key":"everitt_cambridgedictionarystatistics_2010","edition":"4th ed","event-place":"Cambridge, UK ; New York","ISBN":"978-0-521-76699-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"number-of-pages":"468","publisher":"Cambridge University Press","publisher-place":"Cambridge, UK ; New York","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The Cambridge dictionary of statistics","type":"book"},{"id":"evers2020","abstract":"Wine Authentication is a big part of what we do in combating wine fraud here at Cellr, so it made sense to reach out to one of Australia’s most skilled Wine Authenticators, Scott Evers.

Our main goal was to verify if different wine varieties could be differentiated from their VOCs profile, considering changes induced by their age, the yeast inoculated and the type of alcoholic fermentation, establishing those compounds that could be used as chemical markers of a particular variety. Stepwise LDA of selected VOCs allowed 100% differentiation between studied wines, showing that high levels of 1-hexanol were characteristic for Malbec, while low level of ethyl caproate was characteristic for Bonarda. Using controlled fermentations, 1-hexanol, a pre-fermentative VOC, presented a similar trend in wines produced from different yeast; while other fermentative VOCs, like ethyl caproate and ethyl caprilate, presented lower levels for Bonarda but also for Syrah. To our knowledge, this is the first report on characterization of VOCs from Bonarda. Additionally, the quantitative analysis of VOCs profile, coupled to chemometrics, present a good alternative to differentiate wines from different varieties and also for studying wine fermentation.

However, since peaking in the late nineteenth century, harvests are near record lows with many former farms abandoned. While value-added markets present new opportunities to reinvigorate the industry, regional trends associated with climate change may threaten the ability to produce high-quality coffee. Here, we discuss the history of coffee in Puerto Rico, outline important bioclimatic parameters, and model current and future habitat suitability using statistically downscaled climate data. Model projections suggest that warming trends may surpass important temperature thresholds during the coming decades. Under high (A2) and mid-low (A1B) emission scenarios for 2011–2040, Puerto Rico is projected to exceed mean annual temperature parameters for growth of Coffea arabica. Warming and drying trends may accelerate after 2040 and could result in top producing municipalities losing 60–84% of highly suitable growing conditions by 2070. Under the A2 scenario, Puerto Rico may only retain 24 km2 of highly suitable conditions by 2071–2099. High temperatures and low precipitation levels can result in diminished quality and yields, as well as increased exposure and sensitivity to certain insects and diseases. The climate data and models used are based on best current understanding of climate and emission interactions with results best interpreted as projected climate trends rather than predictions of future weather. Planning, innovation, and adaptation provide promising avenues to address current and future socioecological challenges while building a model of sustainable and resilient coffee production in Puerto Rico and throughout the region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Fain","given":"Stephen J."},{"family":"Quiñones","given":"Maya"},{"family":"Álvarez-Berríos","given":"Nora L."},{"family":"Parés-Ramos","given":"Isabel K."},{"family":"Gould","given":"William A."}],"citation-key":"fain-ClimateChangeCoffee-2018","container-title":"Climatic Change","container-title-short":"Climatic Change","DOI":"10.1007/s10584-017-1949-5","ISSN":"1573-1480","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"175-186","source":"Springer Link","title":"Climate change and coffee: assessing vulnerability by modeling future climate suitability in the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico","title-short":"Climate change and coffee","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s10584-017-1949-5","volume":"146"},{"id":"fallacara2018","abstract":"Since its ﬁrst isolation in 1934, hyaluronic acid (HA) has been studied across a variety of research areas. This unbranched glycosaminoglycan consisting of repeating disaccharide units of N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and D-glucuronic acid is almost ubiquitous in humans and in other vertebrates. HA is involved in many key processes, including cell signaling, wound reparation, tissue regeneration, morphogenesis, matrix organization and pathobiology, and has unique physico-chemical properties, such as biocompatibility, biodegradability, mucoadhesivity, hygroscopicity and viscoelasticity. For these reasons, exogenous HA has been investigated as a drug delivery system and treatment in cancer, ophthalmology, arthrology, pneumology, rhinology, urology, aesthetic medicine and cosmetics. To improve and customize its properties and applications, HA can be subjected to chemical modiﬁcations: conjugation and crosslinking. The present review gives an overview regarding HA, describing its history, physico-chemical, structural and hydrodynamic properties and biology (occurrence, biosynthesis (by hyaluronan synthases), degradation (by hyaluronidases and oxidative stress), roles, mechanisms of action and receptors). Furthermore, both conventional and recently emerging methods developed for the industrial production of HA and its chemical derivatization are presented. Finally, the medical, pharmaceutical and cosmetic applications of HA and its derivatives are reviewed, reporting examples of HA-based products that currently are on the market or are undergoing further investigations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Fallacara","given":"Arianna"},{"family":"Baldini","given":"Erika"},{"family":"Manfredini","given":"Stefano"},{"family":"Vertuani","given":"Silvia"}],"citation-key":"fallacara2018","container-title":"Polymers","container-title-short":"Polymers","DOI":"10.3390/polym10070701","ISSN":"2073-4360","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,25]]},"language":"en","page":"701","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hyaluronic Acid in the Third Millennium","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.mdpi.com/2073-4360/10/7/701","volume":"10"},{"id":"fanali_LiquidChromatographyFundamentals_2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,13]]},"citation-key":"fanali_LiquidChromatographyFundamentals_2023","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-323-99968-7.09990-2","editor":[{"family":"Fanali","given":"Salvatore"},{"family":"Chankvetadze","given":"Bezhan"},{"family":"Haddad","given":"Paul R."},{"family":"Poole","given":"Colin"},{"family":"Riekkola","given":"Marja-Liisa"}],"ISBN":"978-0-323-99999-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Liquid Chromatography - Fundamentals and Instrumentation","type":"book","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780323999687099902"},{"id":"farah_CoffeeProductionQuality_2019","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,15]]},"citation-key":"farah_CoffeeProductionQuality_2019","container-title":"Coffee","DOI":"10.1039/9781782622437-FP001","editor":[{"family":"Farah","given":"Adriana"}],"event-place":"Cambridge","ISBN":"978-1-78262-004-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"P001-P004","publisher":"Royal Society of Chemistry","publisher-place":"Cambridge","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Coffee - Production, Quality and Chemistry","type":"chapter","URL":"http://ebook.rsc.org/?DOI=10.1039/9781782622437-FP001"},{"id":"farah-PhenolicCompoundsCoffee-2006","abstract":"Phenolic compounds are secondary metabolites generally involved in plant adaptation to environmental stress conditions. Chlorogenic acids (CGA) and related compounds are the main components of the phenolic fraction of green coffee beans, reaching levels up to 14 % (dry matter basis). These compounds have a number of beneficial health properties related to their potent antioxidant activity as well as hepatoprotective, hypoglycemic and antiviral activities. The main groups of CGA found in green coffee beans include caffeoylquinic acids, dicaffeoylquinic acids, feruloylquinic acids, p-coumaroylquinic acids and mixed diesters of caffeic and ferulic acids with quinic acid, each group with at least three isomers. During coffee processing, CGA may be isomerized, hydrolyzed or degraded into low molecular weight compounds. The high temperatures of roasting also produce transformation of part of CGA into quinolactones and, along with other compounds, melanoidins. This review focuses on the chemical characteristics, biosynthesis, and distribution of CGA and related compounds in coffee. The influence of genetic, physiological and environmental factors as well as processing on the chemical composition of coffee beans is discussed. The impact of CGA composition of green coffee on cup quality is also approached. Despite the existence of substantial published information on the total levels of CGA in coffee, more research is needed on the composition of minor phenolic compounds and specific CGA isomers (and related substances) in green and roasted coffee beans, as well as their impact on coffee quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Farah","given":"Adriana"},{"family":"Donangelo","given":"Carmen Marino"}],"citation-key":"farah-PhenolicCompoundsCoffee-2006","container-title":"Brazilian Journal of Plant Physiology","container-title-short":"Braz.

In Brazil, the oﬃcial method, which has been used to determine nitrite in food, was described by Instituto Adolfo Lutz (283/IV) in 1984. It uses 8 mL of reactants and provides 50 mL (reactants plus sample) of waste per sample analyzed. Here, students scaled down the oﬃcial method 50 times and quantiﬁed nitrite in water and food samples by using just 0.2 mL of the Griess reactant and 1 mL of sample. Quantitative analysis was carried out using absorbance measured at 540 nm (standard method) and 96well-plate images (proposed method) obtained with a desktop scanner. The nitrite was extracted from solid food samples by heating it in a water bath. After heating, sample color and turbidity were eliminated by addition of K4[Fe(CN)6] and ZnSO4 solutions and ﬁltering. During samples preparation, students evaluate the heating time eﬀect in nitrite extraction from sausage samples using hypothesis tests. Students did a series of matrix matched samples to observe the matrix eﬀect. Students also calculated the detection limit (DL) and the quantiﬁcation limit (QL) for the proposed method (1.35 and 4.1 μmol/L nitrite, respectively) and for the standard method (1.1 and 3.4 μmol/L nitrite, respectively). DL and QL were determined using the standard deviation of the lowest concentration point on the standard curve. The major pedagogical value of this laboratory class was to scale down the oﬃcial method and use it to prepare and analyze a solid food sample. As a learning model, ﬁnding real water samples, which have nitrite concentrations larger than method QL, was a hard task, but all sausage samples analyzed had larger nitrate concentrations than the method QL and nitrite quantiﬁcation in sausages was a good learning model.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Filgueiras","given":"Matheus Fernandes"},{"family":"Jesus","given":"Paulo Cesar","non-dropping-particle":"de"},{"family":"Borges","given":"Endler Marcel"}],"citation-key":"filgueiras2021","container-title":"Journal of Chemical Education","container-title-short":"J.

In particular, anthocyanins, flavonols and stilbene derivatives play very important roles in plant metabolism, thanks to their peculiar characteristics. Anthocyanins are responsible for the color of red grapes and wines and confer organoleptic characteristics on the wine. They are used for chemotaxonomic studies and to evaluate the polyphenolic ripening stage of grape. They are natural colorants, have antioxidant, antimicrobial and anticarcinogenic activity, exert protective effects on the human cardiovascular system, and are used in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Stilbenes are vine phytoalexins present in grape berries and associated with the beneficial effects of drinking wine. The principal stilbene, resveratrol, is characterized by anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective activity. Resveratrol dimers and oligomers also occur in grape, and are synthetized by the vine as active defenses against exogenous attack, or produced by extracellular enzymes released from pathogens in an attempt to eliminate undesirable toxic compounds. Flavonols are a ubiquitous class of flavonoids with photo-protection and copigmentation (together with anthocyanins) functions. The lack of expression of the enzyme flavonoid 3',5'-hydroxylase in white grapes restricts the presence of these compounds to quercetin, kaempferol and isorhamnetin derivatives, whereas red grapes usually also contain myricetin, laricitrin and syringetin derivatives. In the last ten years, the technological development of analytical instrumentation, particularly mass spectrometry, has led to great improvements and further knowledge of the chemistry of these compounds. In this review, the biosynthesis and biological role of these grape polyphenols are briefly introduced, together with the latest knowledge of their chemistry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Flamini","given":"Riccardo"},{"family":"Mattivi","given":"Fulvio"},{"family":"Rosso","given":"Mirko"},{"family":"Arapitsas","given":"Panagiotis"},{"family":"Bavaresco","given":"Luigi"}],"citation-key":"flamini_AdvancedKnowledgeThree_2013","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","container-title-short":"IJMS","DOI":"10.3390/ijms141019651","ISSN":"1422-0067","issue":"10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,27]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","page":"19651-19669","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Advanced Knowledge of Three Important Classes of Grape Phenolics: Anthocyanins, Stilbenes and Flavonols","title-short":"Advanced Knowledge of Three Important Classes of Grape Phenolics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/14/10/19651","volume":"14"},{"id":"flanagan_JavaScriptdefinitiveguide_2020","author":[{"family":"Flanagan","given":"David"}],"call-number":"QA76.73.J39 F53 2020","citation-key":"flanagan_JavaScriptdefinitiveguide_2020","edition":"Seventh edition","event-place":"Beijing [China] ; Sebastopol, CA","ISBN":"978-1-4919-5202-3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"number-of-pages":"687","publisher":"O'Reilly Media, Inc","publisher-place":"Beijing [China] ; Sebastopol, CA","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"JavaScript: the definitive guide: master the world's most-used programming language","title-short":"JavaScript","type":"book"},{"id":"florence2021","abstract":"By Rachna Jain Even though the barrel tracking technologies such as QR codes, barcodes and identification labels have been quite popular in the wine sector for a long time, they seem to be under a threat from the radio frequency identification (RFID) technology.

Qualitative research in the history and sociology of science suggests that this choice is patterned by an “essential tension” between productive tradition and risky innovation. We examine this tension through Bourdieu’s field theory of science, and we explore it empirically by analyzing millions of biomedical abstracts from MEDLINE. We represent the evolving state of chemical knowledge with networks extracted from these abstracts. We then develop a typology of research strategies on these networks. Scientists can introduce novel chemicals and chemical relationships (innovation) or delve deeper into known ones (tradition). They can consolidate knowledge clusters or bridge them. The aggregate distribution of published strategies remains remarkably stable. High-risk innovation strategies are rare and reflect a growing focus on established knowledge. An innovative publication is more likely to achieve high impact than a conservative one, but the additional reward does not compensate for the risk of failing to publish. By studying prizewinners in biomedicine and chemistry, we show that occasional gambles for extraordinary impact are a compelling explanation for observed levels of risky innovation. Our analysis of the essential tension identifies institutional forces that sustain tradition and suggests policy interventions to foster innovation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Foster","given":"Jacob G."},{"family":"Rzhetsky","given":"Andrey"},{"family":"Evans","given":"James A."}],"citation-key":"foster-TraditionInnovationScientists-2015","container-title":"American Sociological Review","container-title-short":"Am Sociol Rev","DOI":"10.1177/0003122415601618","ISSN":"0003-1224, 1939-8271","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",10]]},"language":"en","page":"875-908","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Tradition and Innovation in Scientists’ Research Strategies","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0003122415601618","volume":"80"},{"id":"fraga2001","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Fraga","given":"Carlos G."},{"family":"Bruckner","given":"Carsten A."},{"family":"Synovec","given":"Robert E."}],"citation-key":"fraga2001","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

Iterative optimization was then employed to recognize outliers, which belong to the chromatographic peaks, in this vector, and update the outliers in the baseline until convergence. The optimized baseline vector was finally expanded into the original chromatogram, and linear interpolation was employed to estimate background drift in the chromatogram. The principle underlying the proposed method was confirmed using a complex gas chromatographic dataset. Finally, the proposed approach was applied to eliminate background drift in liquid chromatography quadrupole time-of-flight samples used in the metabolic study of Escherichia coli samples. The proposed method was comparable with three classical techniques: morphological weighted penalized least squares, moving window minimum value strategy and background drift correction by orthogonal subspace projection. The proposed method allows almost automatic implementation of background drift correction, which is convenient for practical use.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Fu","given":"Hai-Yan"},{"family":"Li","given":"He-Dong"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Yong-Jie"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Bing"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Cui","given":"Hua-Peng"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Ping-Ping"},{"family":"She","given":"Yuan-Bin"}],"citation-key":"fu_2016","container-title":"Journal of Chromatography A","container-title-short":"Journal of Chromatography A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2016.04.054","ISSN":"0021-9673","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,3]]},"page":"89-99","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Simple automatic strategy for background drift correction in chromatographic data analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021967316304940","volume":"1449"},{"id":"fuhrman-GrapePowderPolyphenols-2005","abstract":"The beneﬁcial health effects of red wine have been attributed to the antioxidant activity of its polyphenols. The present study investigated the effects of a standardized freeze-dried powder made from fresh grapes, rich in grape-speciﬁc polyphenols and free of alcohol, on oxidative stress, atherogenicity of macrophages, and the development of atherosclerotic lesions in apolipoprotein E deﬁcient (E0) mice. Thirty E0 mice were assigned to 3 groups. Mice consumed water alone (control), 150 ␮g total polyphenols/d in the form of grape powder (grape powder), or the equivalent amount of glucose and fructose (placebo) in drinking water for 10 wk. Consumption of grape powder reduced the atherosclerotic lesion area by 41% (P Ͻ 0.0002) compared to the control or placebo mice. The antiatherosclerotic effect was at least partly due to a signiﬁcant 8% reduction in serum oxidative stress, an up to 22% increase in serum antioxidant capacity, a signiﬁcant 33% reduction in macrophage uptake of oxidized LDL, and a 25% decrease in macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL relative to controls. Grape powder directly protected both plasma LDL and macrophages from oxidative stress in vitro. We conclude that polyphenols from fresh grape powder directly affect macrophage atherogenicity by reducing macrophage-mediated oxidation of LDL and cellular uptake of oxidized LDL. Both of these processes can eventually reduce macrophage cholesterol accumulation and foam cell formation and hence attenuate atherosclerosis development. J.

The purpose of this paper is to estimate individual WTP and relate it to likeability for both wines, with and without supplying additional information on their features. Design/methodology/approach Data were collected in May–June 2019 from a sample of 99 consumers in Northern Italy. A non-hypothetical BDM auction in a wine-tasting experiment was implemented. Findings The results show that the additional information plays a significant role in widening the WTP gap between the two geographical indications (GIs), while the blind tasting narrows this gap. The “superiority” of the Conegliano Valdobbiadene Prosecco DOCG is confirmed but relies more on its better reputation than its better taste. Research limitations/implications The authors are aware of two main limitations in the study. The first is the territorial composition of the consumer sample. The second is the selection of the Prosecco bottles used in the experiment. The results are considered pioneering and need to be verified by additional experiments with different consumer and bottle samples. Practical implications Promotional suggestions for the Tutelary Consortia of the two GIs stem from the results.

A simple procedure is presented to determine the esterification degree of a hyaluronan derivative. In this case, the degree of substitution was as low as 14%. The molecular weight distribution of mannuronic oligosaccharides mixture produced by hydrolysis of native polymannuronic is readily calculated from peak area of the species resolved by CE on the basis of a specific degree of polymerization. The influence of the applied electric field strength on the free solution mobility of hyaluronan samples is briefly addressed for molar masses of the order of 105 and 106 g/mol. The data are compared with the results obtained for a 50% galactose-substituted hyaluronic acid (HA). Mobility data obtained as a function of buffer pH for a native HA sample as well as for two galactose-amide HA derivatives, having slightly different degrees of substitution, are presented and discussed in terms of the polymer charge density parameters . In most cases, more questions than answers arise from the application of CE to charged polysaccharides. However, perspectives are disclosed for a further understanding of the reliability of CE applied for the structural elucidation of such macromolecules.","author":[{"family":"Gamini","given":"Amelia"},{"family":"Coslovi","given":"Anna"},{"family":"Rustighi","given":"Isabella"},{"family":"Campa","given":"Cristiana"},{"family":"Vetere","given":"Amedeo"},{"family":"Paoletti","given":"Sergio"}],"citation-key":"gamini","language":"en","page":"44","source":"Zotero","title":"Use of Capillary Electrophoresis for Polysaccharide Studies and Applications","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"gao2020","abstract":"Food safety analysis is an important procedure to control food contamination and supervision.

In order to determine food adulteration eﬃciently, rapid and easy-to-use on-site analytical methods are needed.

The chemical ﬁngerprints of three milk types, ﬁve ﬁsh species, and two coﬀee types were measured using electrospray ionization, desorption electrospray ionization, and low temperature plasma ionization. Minimum sample preparation was needed for the analysis of liquid and solid food samples. Mass spectrometric data was processed using the laboratory-built software MS food classif ier, which allows for the deﬁnition of speciﬁc food proﬁles from reference data sets using multivariate statistical methods and the subsequent classiﬁcation of unknown data. Applicability of the obtained mass spectrometric ﬁngerprints for food authentication was evaluated using diﬀerent data processing methods, leave-10%-out cross-validation, and real-time classiﬁcation of new data. Classiﬁcation accuracy of 100% was achieved for the diﬀerentiation of milk types and ﬁsh species, and a classiﬁcation accuracy of 96.4% was achieved for coﬀee types in crossvalidation experiments. Measurement of two milk mixtures yielded correct classiﬁcation of >94%. For real-time classiﬁcation, the accuracies were comparable. Functionality of the software program and its performance is described. Processing time for a reference data set and a newly acquired spectrum was found to be 12 s and 2 s, respectively.

The pH changes from 2.6 to 1.5 to promote the elution of anthocyanins in their flavylium cationic form. The fluorescence detector enables the limit of quantification of flavan-3-ols to be reduced, and also prevents interferences caused by other phenolics that force the use of time-consuming fractionating protocols. With this method, it was possible to separate and quantify up to 48 phenolic compounds in a single, direct injection: 2 benzoic acids (DAD set at 280nm), 9 hydroxycinnamic acids and GRP (DAD set at 320nm), 7 flavan-3-ols (5 with fluorescence detector set at excitation/emission of 280/320nm, and 2 with DAD set at 280nm), 12 flavonols (DAD set at 360nm), 15 anthocyanins (DAD set at 520nm), and 2 stilbens (DAD set at 320nm).

Not only the high quality of beans but also roasting and brewing times guarantee the best taste and quality of coffee beverages. The aim of the present experiment was to determine the best level of roasting and brewing time for organic and conventional coffee. The experiment was carried out with Peru coffee beans from organic and conventional farms. The contents of caffeine and bioactive compounds were measured in different roasted and brewed coffee drinks. The obtained results showed that the conventional coffee contained significantly more caffeine, total flavonoids, and quercetin derivatives than the organic coffee. On the other hand, the organic coffee was characterized by a higher level of almost all bioactive compounds. The best level of roasting was determined to be medium, and the optimal brewing time was 3 minutes.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Górecki","given":"Maciej"},{"family":"Hallmann","given":"Ewelina"}],"citation-key":"gorecki-AntioxidantContentCoffee-2020","container-title":"Antioxidants","DOI":"10.3390/antiox9040308","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",4]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"4","page":"308","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The Antioxidant Content of Coffee and Its In Vitro Activity as an Effect of Its Production Method and Roasting and Brewing Time","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3921/9/4/308","volume":"9"},{"id":"gorinstein2007","author":[{"family":"Gorinstein","given":"Shela"},{"family":"Jastrzebski","given":"Zenon"},{"family":"Namiesnik","given":"Jacek"},{"family":"Leontowicz","given":"Hanna"},{"family":"Leontowicz","given":"Maria"},{"family":"Trakhtenberg","given":"Simon"}],"citation-key":"gorinstein2007","container-title":"Molecular Nutrition & Food Research","DOI":"10.1002/mnfr.200700064","ISSN":"1613-4125","issue":"11","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",11]]},"note":"WOS:000251006100008","page":"1365-1381","title":"The atherosclerotic heart disease and protecting properties of garlic: contemporary data","type":"article-journal","volume":"51"},{"id":"goyon-CrackingCodeComplex-2022","abstract":"Multidimensional liquid chromatography, coupled to mass spectrometry (MDLC–MS) is a powerful tool for the characterization of complex biopharmaceutical drug modalities, from antibody–drug conjugates to nuclear acid therapeutics like antisense oligonucleotides and small interfering RNA.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Goyon","given":"Alexandre"}],"citation-key":"goyon-CrackingCodeComplex-2022","collection-title":"May 2022","container-title":"LCGC North America","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,2]]},"language":"en","page":"229-231","publisher":"MJH Life Sciences","source":"www.chromatographyonline.com","title":"Cracking the Code of Complex Drug Modalities via Multidimensional Liquid Chromatography Coupled to Mass Spectrometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.chromatographyonline.com/view/enter-the-matrix-improving-the-interpretation-of-separations-data-using-chemometrics-in-analytical-investigations","volume":"40"},{"id":"grant-BriefHistoryCoffee-2020","abstract":"In 2018, a staggering 59 billion coffee capsules were produced.

Using this system, between 25 and 28 of the 32 isomers could be separated, depending on the mobile phase combinations—with resolution that could not possibly be achieved in a single one dimensional separation. The results from this study indicate that in order to fully evaluate the resolving power of a 2D system multiple methods of analysis are most appropriate. This becomes increasingly important when the sample contains components that are very closely related and the retention of solutes is clustered in one quadrant of the 2D space. Ultimately, the usefulness of the 2D separation is determined by the goals of analyst.","author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"Gary R"},{"family":"Wormell","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"R Andrew"},{"family":"Slonecker","given":"Patrick"}],"citation-key":"gray-TwoDimensionalReversedphase-2002","container-title":"J.

Information Theory and a geometric approach to Factor Analysis are two techniques that when used in combination, provide important information on the expected two-dimensional performance. In the present study, we compare the predicted separation performance of two-dimensional systems that have been subjected to analysis by Information Theory and Factor Analysis to that of actual chromatographic separation performance. Our test separation comprised a mixture of 32 oligostyrene structural isomers and stereoisomers. The optimal combination as determined by Information Theory and Factor Analysis consisted of a C18 column with a methanol mobile phase in the ﬁrst dimension and a carbon clad zirconia column with an acetonitrile mobile phase in the second dimension. This system was also shown to be the most successful practical system when a heart-cutting approach was employed. The practical results were in total agreement with the results from Information Theory and Factor Analysis. The number of isomers resolved using this system was 27. A second system, namely one comprising of a C18 column and methanol mobile phase in the ﬁrst dimension and a carbon clad zirconia column with a methanol mobile phase in the second dimension was also predicted to be a system with high separation potential. However, practical assessment of this system did not realise the theoretical predictions, largely due to the long separation times required in the second dimension. Furthermore, all combinations that employed a C18 column with an acetonitrile mobile phase in the ﬁrst dimension failed to realise the theoretical separation potential due to high solute crowding, low orthogonality and a disordered arrangement of bands along the ﬁrst separation axis. This was also predicted by the theoretical assessment.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Michael J."},{"family":"Dennis","given":"Gary R."},{"family":"Slonecker","given":"Patrick J."},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"R.Andrew"}],"citation-key":"gray2004","container-title":"Journal of Chromatography A","container-title-short":"Journal of Chromatography A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2003.10.123","ISSN":"00219673","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",3]]},"language":"en","page":"247-257","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Separation of oligostyrene isomers in a complex mixture using two-dimensional heart-cutting reversed-phased liquid chromatography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021967303020223","volume":"1028"},{"id":"gray2004b","abstract":"A comprehensive two-dimensional reversed-phase reversed-phase liquid chromatographic system for the separation of a complex mixture of oligostyrenes was developed using results from a previous theoretical assessment of the informational similarity, percent synentropy, orthogonality and peak capacity of hypothetically coupled systems.

High sampling rates in the ﬁrst liquid chromatographic dimension were shown to be impossible or inefﬁcient when the peak capacity and separation time of the second dimension was high or when the aim of the exercise was to isolate individual sample constituents in high yield.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Michael J"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"Gary R"},{"family":"Slonecker","given":"Patrick J"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"R.Andrew"}],"citation-key":"gray2004b","container-title":"Journal of Chromatography A","container-title-short":"Journal of Chromatography A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2004.04.039","ISSN":"00219673","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",7]]},"language":"en","page":"101-110","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Comprehensive two-dimensional separations of complex mixtures using reversed-phase reversed-phase liquid chromatography","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021967304006399","volume":"1041"},{"id":"gray2005","archive_location":"WOS:000228875400002","author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"MJ"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"GR"},{"family":"Slonecker","given":"PJ"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"gray2005","container-title":"JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2004.10.071","ISSN":"0021-9673","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",5,6]]},"page":"3-9","title":"Utilising retention correlation for the separation of oligostyrenes by coupled-column liquid chromatography","type":"article-journal","volume":"1073"},{"id":"gray2013","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Gray","given":"Robert M."}],"citation-key":"gray2013","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"publisher":"Information Systems Laboratory Electrical Engineering Department Stanford University","title":"Entropy and Information Theory","type":"book","URL":"https://ee.stanford.edu/~gray/it.pdf"},{"id":"greibrokk_ContributionsCsabaHorvath_2004","abstract":"This article is not a biographic description of the life of Csaba Horvath, but an attempt to describe his most important contributions to liquid chromatography, as viewed by an author who himself started with HPLC in 1973. With the introduction of columns packed with rigid pellicular particles, which could withstand high pressures, the combination of fast separations with high efficiency was designated high pressure liquid chromatography about 35 years ago. The contribution of Horvath to the birth of modern LC was to imagine the potential for high-speed separations in LC by transferring ideas and technology from gas chromatography. From this time, his strong participation in understanding and describing the processes of separation science made him a leading scientist in fundamental studies of separation principles until his passing away in April 2004. In addition to being one of the forefathers of modern liquid chromatography, Csaba Horvath described both the ionic interactions and the hydrophobic interactions on ion exchangers as well as on reversed phase materials and developed a theoretical basis for understanding these processes. If one person should be mentioned as the inventor of ion-pair chromatography of organic compounds, of hydrophobic interaction chromatography, and of the theoretical basis for reversed phase chromatography, this person is Csaba Horvath. Throughout the last 30 years he also had a strong interest in studying proteins in separation processes, and in the last decade he made valuable contributions to capillary electrochromatography, particularly for separation of proteins on monolithic columns. For this author is difficult to find another person who has had a greater impact on liquid chromatography than Csaba Horvath.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Greibrokk","given":"T."}],"citation-key":"greibrokk_ContributionsCsabaHorvath_2004","container-title":"Journal of Separation Science","container-title-short":"J.

The overall reduced HETP was derived from the true moments of the recorded concentration profiles. The longitudinal diffusion HETP term was measured at a very small flow rate (0.05 mL/min). The solid-liquid mass transfer resistance was derived from the shell diffusivity, using the composite Garnett-Torquato model of effective diffusion in a heterogeneous system made of a dense packing of core-shell particles immersed in a continuous matrix (the eluent). The trans-channel and short-range interchannel eddy dispersion HETP terms were assumed to be equal to the calculated h data after solving the Navier-Stokes equation and simulating the advection-diffusion transport process. Experimental results confirmed that the optimum efficiency of these short columns was increased by a factor of about two. The ratio of the detection sensitivities on the PSFC stream and on a regular stream increased from 1 to 1.45 when the retention factor decreases from about 10 to 0.5. These phenomena are due to a strong reduction of the trans-column eddy dispersion HETP term.

The total reduced heights equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) were carefully measured, using the first and second central moments of the elution band profiles, obtained by its accurate numerical integration. The longitudinal diffusion term was measured at the lowest experimental reduced velocity applied. The solid-liquid mass transfer resistance was estimated from measurements of the intra-particle diffusivity using the Torquato's model of effective diffusion in packed beds. The trans-channel and short-range interchannel eddy diffusion HETP terms were taken from data obtained by solving numerically the Navier-Stokes equations and simulating advective-diffusive transport in computer-generated random sphere packings. The results clearly show that the trans-column eddy diffusion HETP term can account for up to 85% of the total intrinsic HETP (corrected for extra-column contributions) of the standard columns. Parallel segmented flow chromatography can reduce this contribution by half at high velocities, by eliminating most of the baseline peak tailing. This holds true irrespective of the retention factor of the analyte. It was found also that segmenting the inlet/outlet flow increases detection sensitivity by 25-50% for peaks with large to small retention factors, respectively. In practice, the advantage of parallel segmented flow chromatography in gradient elution (thin peak widths) is essentially limited by post-column bandspreading and diffusion in the dwell volume of the instrument used. Analyst should minimize post-column bandspreading (caused by connectors and detection cell volume) and synchronize the eluent composition in the peripheral and central inlet ports of the column, by using two separate pumps with appropriate dwell volumes.

For each column length and particle type, two different configurations were tested: (1) both the inlet and outlet column endfittings were standard and (2) the inlet endfitting was standard but the outlet endfitting allowed parallel segmentation of the exiting flow into a central and a peripheral coaxial region. The segmentation flow ratio was set at 45% (for 3 mu m) and at 43% or 21% (for 5 mu m). Four samples were used, naphthalene, toluene, butylbenzene, and insulin, which has a ten times smaller diffusion coefficient than the small molecules.\nThe column performance for the low molecular weight compound is significantly improved at velocities above the optimum value when the outlet flow rate is segmented because longitudinal diffusion and mass transfer resistance of this compound in the stationary phase are negligible sources of band broadening at reduced linear velocities between 5 and 25. At high flow rate (4 mL/min), the long-range eddy dispersion terms are about 3.9, 3.2, 2.6, and 1.8 h unit lower for the 3, 5, 7.5 and 10 cm long columns, respectively. The longer the column, the lower the efficiency improvement because the border effects are smaller. This result was not systematically observed for the columns packed with 5 mu m particles because the transverse dispersion is larger. In contrast, the gain in column efficiency is marginal for insulin because the mass transfer mechanism of this compound is mostly controlled by the slow diffusivity of insulin across Hypurity-C-18 particles.

This technique is based on alignment points that have locations indicated by the user both in a target chromatogram and in a reference chromatogram. We applied the algorithm to two sets of samples. First, we aligned the chromatograms of twelve compositionally distinct oil spill samples, all analyzed using the same instrument parameters. Second, we applied the algorithm to two compositionally distinct wastewater extracts analyzed using two different instrument temperature programs, thus involving larger retention time shifts than the first sample set.

We selected 47 serum amino acid and carnitine indicators from targeted metabolomics studies using LC‒MS/MS and age and sex demographic indicators of the subjects. After screening by a stepwise regression algorithm, 16 metrics were included. The XGBoost model in the machine learning algorithm showed superior predictive power (AUC = 0.81, accuracy = 75.29%, sensitivity = 74%), with the metabolic biomarkers ornithine and palmitoylcarnitine being potential biomarkers to screen for lung cancer.

For these cases we need two-dimensional chromatography because it takes far less time to generate a peak capacity\nn\nc\ntwice in a row than to generate a peak capacity\nn\nc\n2\nonce. Liquid chromatography has been carried out successfully on thin layers of adsorbents and along tubes filled with various adsorbents. The first type of separation sorts out the sample components in a physical separation space that is the layer of packing material. The analysis time is the same for all the components of the sample while their migration distance increases with decreasing retention. The resolution between two components having a certain separation factor (\nα\n) increases with increasing migration distance, i.e., from the strongly to the weakly retained compounds. In the second type of separation, the sample components are eluted from the column and separated in the time space, their migration distances are all the same while their retention times increase from the unretained to the strongly retained compounds. Separation efficiency varies little with retention, as long as the components are eluted from the column. We call these two types of separation the chromatographic separations in space (LC\nx\n) and the chromatographic separations in time (LC\nt\n), respectively. In principle, there are four ways to combine these two modes and do two-dimensional chromatographic separations,\nLC\nt\n×\nLC\nt\n,\nLC\nx\n×\nLC\nt\n,\nLC\nt\n×\nLC\nx\n, and\nLC\nx\n×\nLC\nx\n. We review, discuss and compare the potential performance of these combinations, their advantages, drawbacks, problems, perspectives and results. Currently, column-based combinations (\nLC\nt\n×\nLC\nt\n) are the most actively pursued. We suggest that the combination\nLC\nx\n×\nLC\nt\nshows exceptional promise because it permits the simultaneous second-dimension separations of all the fractions separated in the first-dimension, thus providing remarkable time saving.","author":[{"family":"Guiochon","given":"Georges"},{"family":"Marchetti","given":"Nicola"},{"family":"Mriziq","given":"Khaled"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RAndrew"}],"citation-key":"guiochon_Implementationstwodimensionalliquid_2008","container-title":"Journal of Chromatography A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2008.01.086","event-place":"Amsterdam","ISSN":"0021-9673","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",2,16]]},"language":"eng","page":"109–168","publisher":"Elsevier BV","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"west-sydney-primo.com","title":"Implementations of two-dimensional liquid chromatography","type":"article-journal","volume":"1189"},{"id":"guiochon2006","abstract":"The practical limit of the separation power of HPLC depends on time, money, and skill.

It also depends on the properties of the packing material selected (e.g., its particle size, its pore geometry, and its connectivity) and on the packing method used since it affects the coefﬁcients of the HETP equation. Finally, it depends on the thermal stability of the sample and the packing material. The complexity of the sample also plays an important role in that it determines whether the analysis should be made under isocratic, isothermal conditions, in gradient elution, in temperature programming, or with a combination of both types of programming.

It is composed of alcohols, sugars, acids, minerals, proteins and other compounds, such as organic acids and volatile and phenolic compounds (also called polyphenols). Polyphenols have been shown to be highly related to both (i) wine quality (color, flavor, and taste) and (ii) health-promoting properties (antioxidant and cardioprotective among others). Polyphenols can be grouped into two big families: (i) Flavonoids, including anthocyanidins, flavonols, flavanols, hydrolysable and condensed tannins, flavanones, flavones and chalcones; and (ii) Non-flavonoids, including hydroxycinnamic acids, hydroxybenzoic acids, stilbenes, tyrosol and hydroxytyrosol. Each group affects in some way the different properties of wine to a greater or a lesser extent. For that reason, the phenolic composition can be managed to obtain singular wines with specific, desirable characteristics. The current review presents a summary of the ways in which the phenolic composition of wine can be modulated, including (a) invariable factors such as variety, field management or climatic conditions; (b) pre-fermentative strategies such as maceration, thermovinification and pulsed electric field; (c) fermentative strategies such as the use of different yeasts and bacteria; and (d) post-fermentative strategies such as maceration, fining agents and aging.

This review summarized the effect of viticultural techniques to delay grapevine ripening with emphasis on canopy management and we overviewed the effects of high temperatures on grape and wine quality. Some viticultural techniques such as severe shoot trimming, minimal pruning, late winter pruning and apical leaf removal may delay grapevine ripening close to 15 days.

'Active flow technology' (AFT) is known to greatly improve the performance of pristine columns, but is as of yet untested when used on columns that have degraded significantly. In this study AFT was used to regenerate a degraded column, where the reduced plate height and asymmetry values were 3.5 and 1.25 respectively. Once the AFT fittings were fitted to the column outlet and the flow segmentation ratio adjusted to 28% from the radial central exit port, the reduced plate height decreased to 2.0, and the bands were almost perfectly symmetrical with asymmetry factors equal to 1.04. Subsequently, the performance of the degraded column with AFT fittings provided performance that was comparable to that of a new conventional column fitted with traditional end fittings.\nThe separation power of the degraded conventional column and that of the same column fitted with the AFT end fittings was then tested using the separation of oligostyrenes. In AFT mode, detection was undertaken at both the radial central exit port of the column and the peripheral exit port. The resulting separation that was achieved from the radial central exit port was superior to that observed on the conventional column, whereas, the separation observed from the peripheral port was very poor. It was subsequently determined that the reason for the degraded performance of the conventional column was a result of increased heterogeneity associated with the packing material in the wall region of the column.

It is expedient to distinguish the variables on the basis of three scales: nominal, ordinal, and numeric. The nominal scales are qualitative only and can be measured solely in terms of whether the individual items belong to some distinctively different categories. The ordinal scales are also qualitative, but they can rank (order) the items measured in terms of which has less and which has more of the quality represented by the variable, and the numerical scale is quantitative in nature. There are numerous applications evaluating results of instrumental–analytical methods such as mass spectrometry, NMR spectroscopy, and chromatography using chemoinformatics. Combinations involving NMR spectroscopy and chromatography have many applications in the biomedical field. On the other hand, although chemometric techniques are frequently applied to analyze mass spectral data, applications in the biomedical field are rare. Multivariate data analysis is applied to mass spectrometry, especially revealing relationships of mass spectral data and chemical structure. Pyrolysis mass spectrometry and chemometrics are coupled to analyze the adulteration of orange juice quantitatively, to test the authenticity of honey, and to discriminate the unfractionated plant extracts.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Héberger","given":"KÁROLY"}],"citation-key":"heberger-ChapterChemoinformaticsMultivariate-2008","container-title":"Medical Applications of Mass Spectrometry","DOI":"10.1016/B978-044451980-1.50009-4","editor":[{"family":"Vékey","given":"Károly"},{"family":"Telekes","given":"András"},{"family":"Vertes","given":"Akos"}],"event-place":"Amsterdam","ISBN":"978-0-444-51980-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008",1,1]]},"language":"en","page":"141-169","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher-place":"Amsterdam","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Chapter 7 - Chemoinformatics—multivariate mathematical–statistical methods for data evaluation","type":"chapter","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780444519801500094"},{"id":"heberger-ChemoinformaticsMultivariateMathematical-2008","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Héberger","given":"Károly"}],"citation-key":"heberger-ChemoinformaticsMultivariateMathematical-2008","container-title":"Medical Applications of Mass Spectrometry","DOI":"10.1016/B978-044451980-1.50009-4","ISBN":"978-0-444-51980-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"en","page":"141-169","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chemoinformatics—multivariate mathematical–statistical methods for data evaluation","type":"chapter","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780444519801500094"},{"id":"helwig_estimatinglatenttrends_2017","abstract":"Longitudinal data are inherently multimode in the sense that such data are often collected across multiple modes of variation, for example, time × variables × subjects. In many longitudinal studies, multiple variables are collected to measure some latent construct(s) of interest. In such cases, the goal is to understand temporal trends in the latent variables, as well as individual differences in the trends. Multimode component analysis models provide a powerful framework for discovering latent trends in longitudinal data. However, classic implementations of multimode models do not take into consideration functional information (i.e., the temporal sequence of the collected data) or structural information (i.e., which variables load onto which latent factors) about the study design. In this paper, we reveal how functional and structural constraints can be imposed in multimode models (Parafac and Parafac2) in order to elucidate trends in longitudinal data. As a motivating example, we consider a longitudinal study on per capita alcohol consumption trends conducted from 1970 to 2013 by the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. We demonstrate how functional and structural information about the study design can be incorporated into the Parafac and Parafac2 alternating least squares algorithms to understand temporal and regional trends in three latent constructs: beer consumption, spirits consumption, and wine consumption. Our results reveal that Americans consume more than the recommended amount of alcohol, and total alcohol consumption trends show no signs of decreasing in the last decade.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Helwig","given":"Nathaniel E."}],"citation-key":"helwig_estimatinglatenttrends_2017","container-title":"Biometrical Journal","container-title-short":"Biometrical J","DOI":"10.1002/bimj.201600045","ISSN":"0323-3847, 1521-4036","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017",7]]},"language":"en","license":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/termsAndConditions#vor","page":"783-803","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Estimating latent trends in multivariate longitudinal data via Parafac2 with functional and structural constraints","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/bimj.201600045","volume":"59"},{"id":"henschke_winesearcher","citation-key":"henschke_winesearcher","title":"1990 Henschke Mount Edelstone Shiraz","type":"manuscript","URL":"https://www.wine-searcher.com/find/henschke+mnt+edelstone+sra+eden+valley+barossa+south+australia/1990?Xsort_order=p"},{"id":"henshaw_waysunderstandmatrix_2022","abstract":"Boost your intuition for matrix multiplication","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Henshaw","given":"Glenn"}],"citation-key":"henshaw_waysunderstandmatrix_2022","container-title":"Medium","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,13]]},"language":"en","title":"3 Ways to Understand Matrix Multiplication","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://ghenshaw-work.medium.com/3-ways-to-understand-matrix-multiplication-fe8a007d7b26"},{"id":"heyns_betterbibtexzotero_2018","abstract":"Better BibTeX (BBT) is a plugin for Zotero and Juris-M that makes it easier to manage bibliographic data, especially for people authoring documents using text-based toolchains (e.g. based on LaTeX / Markdown).\nFeatures Facilities for generating citation keys Automatically generate citation keys without key clashes!

The developed ANNs are able to reveal the relationships between the concentration of total phenolic, flavonoids, anthocyanins, and tannins content, associated to the antioxidant activity, and the wine distinctive classes determined by the wine variety, harvesting year or winery. The presented ANNs proved to be reliable software tools for assessment or validation of the wine essential characteristics and authenticity and may be further used to establish a database of analytical characteristics of wines.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Hosu","given":"Anamaria"},{"family":"Cristea","given":"Vasile-Mircea"},{"family":"Cimpoiu","given":"Claudia"}],"citation-key":"hosu_2014","container-title":"Food Chemistry","container-title-short":"Food Chemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2013.10.153","ISSN":"0308-8146","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5,1]]},"language":"en","page":"113-118","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Analysis of total phenolic, flavonoids, anthocyanins and tannins content in Romanian red wines: Prediction of antioxidant activities and classification of wines using artificial neural networks","title-short":"Analysis of total phenolic, flavonoids, anthocyanins and tannins content in Romanian red wines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0308814613016026","volume":"150"},{"id":"hotelling_analysiscomplexstatistical_1933","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Hotelling","given":"H."}],"citation-key":"hotelling_analysiscomplexstatistical_1933","container-title":"Journal of Educational Psychology","container-title-short":"Journal of Educational Psychology","DOI":"10.1037/h0071325","ISSN":"1939-2176, 0022-0663","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["1933",9]]},"language":"en","page":"417-441","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Analysis of a complex of statistical variables into principal components.","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.apa.org/doi/10.1037/h0071325","volume":"24"},{"id":"howtwos1012018","abstract":"This video will show you how to install Latex, and make your first PDF output on Windows 10. This is not the only software or method for doing it, just the way that has worked best for me. You will just need to install 2 software packages, MiKTeX and Texmaker. Texmaker is the editor for Latex, where MiKTeX handles the compiling.\n\nMiKTeX can be downloaded from: https://miktex.org/help\n\nTexmaker can be downloaded from: http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/downl...\n\nAfter you have them downloaded, just run through the installation. You can essentially select the defaults for installation for both.\n\nOnce the installations are finished, open Texmaker. To make your first Latex document, just click on new at the top left. After that, I would paste in some known working Latex so you can test it out. In the video I used: http://mally.stanford.edu/~sr/computi...\n\nClick the arrow to the left of quick build to compile the latex document. It should ask you if you want to install lingmacros, because it is the first time that has been used, so just click yes to install it. It will not ask you if you want to install tree-dvips because that is included in the Latex installation already.\n\nAfter the package installation is completed, then the compiled PDF will show up on the right. If you make a change and compile again, it will compile much faster because it has all of the packages required.\n\nCheck out my facebook at: https://www.facebook.com/pages/All-Ho...\n\nor my twitter: https://twitter.com/AllHow2s\n\nOr my website where I have a lot of other great tutorials (such as how to take a screenshot, or how to get the start button back on Windows 8): http://www.allhow2s.com","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,17]]},"citation-key":"howtwos1012018","dimensions":"5:10","director":[{"literal":"howtwos101"}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7,21]]},"source":"YouTube","title":"How to Get Started with Latex on Windows 10 Texmaker MiKTeX","type":"motion_picture","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oI8W4MvFo1M"},{"id":"hronis","abstract":"We know stressful circumstances make people more vulnerable to developing addictions.

For these compounds it was observed that the m/e values of the peaks in the mass spectra are highly correlated, while a number of chromatographic columns can be found on which the retention data are only slightly correlated. As a result, the information content of two-dimensional gas chromatographic retention data on such columns equals the information content of binary-encoded low-resolution mass spectra. It is shown that the accuracy and precision of retention data in gas-liquid chromatography, and therefore the information content, can be significantly improved if the data are corrected for adsorption effects of the solid support and extrapolated to a limiting value in the case of asymmetric peaks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Huber","given":"J.

High-performance liquid chromatography coupled with UV–Vis spectroscopy (HPLC–UV–Vis) is a common analysis method used to obtain the molecular profile of wine samples. We propose a complete procedure for the analysis of wine chromatograms. Data are pre-processed using standard methods of down-sampling, smoothing and baseline subtraction. Multiple samples are then merged in a three-dimensional tensor, decomposed using parallel factor analysis (PARAFAC2) into three factors: (i) one reduced (rank-one) chromatogram per sample, (ii) an estimate of the samples’ spectral UV–Vis profile and (iii) an estimate of the samples’ concentrations. If the decomposition is performed on a single peak of the tensor, the second and third factors correspond to the representative wavelength spectrum and to the relative concentrations of the samples, respectively. Otherwise, when multiple peaks are analysed, further processing is required. In the latter case, the decomposed rank-one chromatograms are peak-detected and aligned, clustered and integrated. A table containing the concentration of the peaks at different retention times is obtained. The pipeline proposed in this study is a guideline for a quantitative and reproducible chemical analysis of wine, or other samples, via the HPLC–UV–Vis method.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ianeselli","given":"Alan"},{"family":"Longo","given":"Edoardo"},{"family":"Poggesi","given":"Simone"},{"family":"Montali","given":"Marco"},{"family":"Boselli","given":"Emanuele"}],"citation-key":"ianeselli_completeanalysispipeline_2024","container-title":"Chromatographia","container-title-short":"Chromatographia","DOI":"10.1007/s10337-023-04301-z","ISSN":"0009-5893, 1612-1112","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",3]]},"language":"en","page":"159-166","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Complete Analysis Pipeline for the Processing, Alignment and Quantification of HPLC–UV Wine Chromatograms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10337-023-04301-z","volume":"87"},{"id":"ibm_Stoppingwinefraud_2021","abstract":"Counterfeiting wine is big business in Australia but new innovations in blockchain will make it harder for scammers to rip off customers.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,8]]},"author":[{"family":"ibm","given":""}],"citation-key":"ibm_Stoppingwinefraud_2021","container-title":"IBM A/NZ Blog","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1,6]]},"language":"en-US","license":"© Copyright IBM Corp. 2021","title":"Stopping wine fraud with technology","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.ibm.com/blogs/ibm-anz/stopping-wine-fraud-with-technology/"},{"id":"ibm_whatdatamodeling_2021","abstract":"Data modeling is the process of creating a visual representation of an information system to communicate connections between data points and structures.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"IBM","given":""}],"citation-key":"ibm_whatdatamodeling_2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,29]]},"language":"en","title":"What Is Data Modeling? | IBM","title-short":"What Is Data Modeling?","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.ibm.com/topics/data-modeling"},{"id":"icandsocialaffairs","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,2]]},"author":[{"family":"ic and Social Affairs","given":""}],"citation-key":"icandsocialaffairs","container-title":"United Nations","title":"THE 17 GOALS | Sustainable Development","type":"webpage","URL":"https://sdgs.un.org/goals"},{"id":"ico-WorldCoffeeConsumption-2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"ICO","given":""},{"family":"Organization","given":"International Coffee"}],"citation-key":"ico-WorldCoffeeConsumption-2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5]]},"title":"World Coffee Consumption","type":"webpage","URL":"http://www.ico.org/prices/new-consumption-table.pdf"},{"id":"iii-Chroma-2022","abstract":"A software for post-processing chromatograms","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",6,16]]},"author":[{"family":"III","given":"Jim Shepich"}],"citation-key":"iii-Chroma-2022","genre":"Python","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,19]]},"license":"MIT","original-date":{"date-parts":[["2020",10,30]]},"source":"GitHub","title":"M|Chroma","type":"software","URL":"https://github.com/epicshepich/MChroma"},{"id":"im2007","archive_location":"WOS:000243839900032","author":[{"family":"Im","given":"K"},{"family":"Park","given":"HW"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Y"},{"family":"Chung","given":"BH"},{"family":"Ree","given":"M"},{"family":"Chang","given":"TH"}],"citation-key":"im2007","container-title":"ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","DOI":"10.1021/ac061738n","ISSN":"0003-2700","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",2,1]]},"page":"1067-1072","title":"Comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography analysis of a block copolymer","type":"article-journal","volume":"79"},{"id":"ingold_1968","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ingold","given":"K.

We begin with a careful treatment of PV diagrams, and by pictorially integrating the appropriate area in a PV diagram, we introduce work. This starting point allows us to elucidate the concept of state functions and nonstate functions. The students readily appreciate that for a given transition, the area enclosed by the PV curve (work) depends on the path taken. It is then argued that heat, within this chosen framework, is a consequence of energy conservation and the fact that work is not a state function. This leads to a visual introduction of all the components involved in the first law of thermodynamics. The PV diagrams are then used to introduce entropy as being related to the maximum possible work to be done by the system. This macroscopic description of entropy is then related to the usual microscopic view of Boltzmann. This equivalence connects the area inside the PV diagram (work from a specific kind of pathway) and the number of microstates involved in the Boltzmann expression. The connection between the macroscopic and microscopic description of entropy also illuminates the exponential dependence of the number of microstates (or probability) on an energy, known as free energy.

It is particularly useful because of its ability to handle shifts in the elution time mode and peak shape changes. Like all curve resolution techniques, PARAFAC2 will only find chemically meaningful parameters (elution time profiles and mass spectra) if the correct number of factors are determined. So far, the primary way to determine an appropriate number of factors, when using PARAFAC2, is to calculate models with different number of factors and then inspect the models manually. This approach is time consuming, and the result may be biased because of the manual assessment of the model quality, making PARAFAC2 inaccessible for analytical chemists in general. Here, we develop a method that can determine an appropriate number of factors in an automated way. The automation is based on a number of model diagnostics (quality criteria) collected from models with different numbers of factors. Combining these diagnostics, it is possible to assess what the appropriate number of components is. In this work, only gas chromatography–mass spectrometry data are considered. However, it will most likely be fairly straightforward to expand the work to also cover liquid chromatography data (with a multivariate detector). Automating the model quality evaluation of the PARAFAC2 model enables both the inexperienced and trained user to perform comprehensive and advanced analysis of chromatographic data with a minimum of manual work. © 2013 The Authors.\n              Journal of Chemometrics\n              Published by John Wiley & Sons Ltd.\n            \n          , \n            A new approach for automatically modeling GC‐MS data using PARAFAC2 has been developed.

Some of the earliest reported cases of food fraud, dating back thousands of years, involved olive oil, tea, wine, and spices. These products continue to be associated with fraud, along with some other foods. Although the vast majority of fraud incidents do not pose a public health risk, some cases have resulted in actual or potential public health risks. Perhaps the most high-profile case has involved the addition of melamine to high-protein feed and milk-based products to artificially inflate protein values in products that may have been diluted. In 2007, pet food adulterated with melamine reportedly killed a large number of dogs and cats in the United States, followed by reports that melamine-contaminated baby formula had sickened thousands of Chinese children. Fraud was also a motive behind Peanut Corporation of America’s actions in connection with the Salmonella outbreak in 2009, which killed 9 people and sickened 700. Reports also indicate that fish and seafood fraud is widespread, consisting mostly of a lowervalued species, which may be associated with some types of food poisoning or allergens, mislabeled as a higher-value species. Other types of foods associated with fraud include honey, meat and grain-based foods, fruit juices, organic foods, coffee, and some highly processed foods.","author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Renée"}],"citation-key":"johnson_FoodFraudEconomically_2014","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",1,10]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Food Fraud and \"Economically Motivated Adulteration\" of Food and Food Ingredients","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"johnson_WorldAtlasWine_2019","abstract":"Concentrating on wine-producing regions of the world, this atlas emphasizes the relationship between geography and its effects on a wine's character and notes important geographic features of famous vineyards","author":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Hugh"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Jancis"}],"call-number":"TP548 .J66 2019","citation-key":"johnson_WorldAtlasWine_2019","edition":"Eighth edition","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-78472-403-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"number-of-pages":"416","publisher":"Mitchell Beazley","publisher-place":"London","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The world atlas of wine","type":"book"},{"id":"johnson_worldatlaswine_2019a","citation-key":"johnson_worldatlaswine_2019a","edition":"8th edition","editor":[{"family":"Johnson","given":"Hugh"},{"family":"Robinson","given":"Jancis"}],"event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1-78472-403-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"416","publisher":"Mitchell Beazley","publisher-place":"London","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"The world atlas of wine","type":"book"},{"id":"jones_2016","abstract":"A protocol for the use of reaction flow high performance liquid chromatography columns for methods employing post column derivatization (PCD) is presented. A major difficulty in adapting PCD to modern HPLC systems and columns is the need for large volume reaction coils that enable reagent mixing and then the derivatization reaction to take place. This large post column dead volume leads to band broadening, which results in a loss of observed separation efficiency and indeed detection in sensitivity. In reaction flow post column derivatization (RF-PCD) the derivatization reagent(s) are pumped against the flow of mobile phase into either one or two of the outer ports of the reaction flow column where it is mixed with column effluent inside a frit housed within the column end fitting. This technique allows for more efficient mixing of the column effluent and derivatization reagent(s) meaning that the volume of the reaction loops can be minimized or even eliminated altogether. It has been found that RF-PCD methods perform better than conventional PCD methods in terms of observed separation efficiency and signal to noise ratio. A further advantage of RF-PCD techniques is the ability to monitor effluent coming from the central port in its underivatized state. RF-PCD has currently been trialed on a relatively small range of post column reactions, however, there is currently no reason to suggest that RF-PCD could not be adapted to any existing one or two component (as long as both reagents are added at the same time) post column derivatization reaction.","archive_location":"WOS:000380256000019","author":[{"family":"Jones","given":"A"},{"family":"Pravadali-Cekic","given":"S"},{"family":"Hua","given":"S"},{"family":"Kocic","given":"D"},{"family":"Camenzuli","given":"M"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"G"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"jones_2016","container-title":"JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS","DOI":"10.3791/53462","ISSN":"1940-087X","issue":"110","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",4]]},"language":"English","title":"Post Column Derivatization Using Reaction Flow High Performance Liquid Chromatography Columns","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"jones_futureliquidchromatographic_2018","abstract":"The coupling of high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with post column derivatisation (HPLC-PCD) will increase the sensitivity of an instrument to the target molecule, improve specificity by selective derivatisation to remove potential interferences from the matrix, and be cost-effective; all these factors may well prove that PCD is an alternative to existing techniques for routine analysis. Calcidiol (25(OH)D) concentrations are used in the determination of vitamin D deficiency in humans, and there is growing interest and demand in its analysis with some controversy surrounding the sensitivity and specificity of its detection. 25(OH)D analysis is currently performed using either competitive binding assays or HPLC analysis, coupled with detection by a variety of means, such as, UV-Vis absorption, electrochemical or mass spectroscopy (MS) detection. HPLC coupled with MS (HPLC-MS) detection is the gold standard for 25(OH)D analysis due to its sensitivity and selectivity compared to all other techniques, however, its utility is limited by its high cost. This article reviews the current status of HPLC based techniques in the detection of 25(OH)D (and its metabolites), and further explores the use of HPLC-PCD.

One drawback with PCD techniques is the extra post-column dead volume due to reaction coils used to enable adequate reaction time and the mixing of reagents which causes peak broadening, hence a loss of separation power. This loss of efficiency is counter-productive to modern HPLC technologies, -such as UHPLC. We reviewed 87 PCD methods published from 2009 to 2014. We restricted our review to methods published between 2009 and 2014, because we were interested in the uptake of PCD methods in UHPLC environments. Our review focused on a range of system parameters including: column dimensions, stationary phase and particle size, as well as the geometry of the reaction loop. The most commonly used column in the methods investigated was not in fact a modern UHPLC version with sub-2-micron, (or even sub-3-micron) particles, but rather, work-house columns, such as, 250 x 4.6 mm i.d. columns packed with 5 mu m C18 particles. Reaction loops were varied, even within the same type of analysis, but the majority of methods employed loop systems with volumes greater than 500 mu L.\nA second part of this review illustrated briefly the effect of dead volume on column performance. The experiment evaluated the change in resolution and separation efficiency of some weak to moderately retained solutes on a 250 x 4.6 mm i.d. column packed with 5 mu m particles. The data showed that reaction loops beyond 100 mu L resulted in a very serious loss of performance.\nOur study concluded that practitioners of PCD methods largely avoid the use of UHPLC-type column formats, so yes, very much, PCD is incompatible with the modern HPLC column.

The detection responses included: underivatised UV at 280 nm, underivatised fluorescence detection (FLD) and a post column derivatisation (PCD) colorimetric response for antioxidants via the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) assay. Both similarities and differences in the chromatograms obtained using the three detection modes highlight the power of multiplexed detection. The main findings from the bioactive profiling include: the Fruit of the Forest tea contains the lowest level of antioxidants and is clearly distinct from the other three teas which are based on Camellia sinensis. The antioxidants detected in the green tea and the two black teas are similar. The green tea contains a higher concentration of the two main antioxidants that eluted at 4.0 and 5.7 min. The simplicity of sample analysis and chemical profiling using RF columns and selective detection was the focus of this study via the analysis of antioxidants in tea using the FRAP reagent. The main advantage of RF-PCD is the ability to split flows for simultaneous detection with minimal post column dead volume contributions, making peak matching between detectors much easier. To date, few studies exploit the power of RF-PCD multiplexed detection to differentiate and identify bioactive compounds in various complex samples.

We develop two probabilistic formulations of the PARAFAC2 model along with variational Bayesian procedures for inference: In the first approach, the mean values of the factor loadings are orthogonal leading to closed form variational updates, and in the second, the factor loadings themselves are orthogonal using a matrix Von Mises–Fisher distribution. We contrast our probabilistic formulations to the conventional direct fitting algorithm based on maximum likelihood on synthetic data and real fluorescence spectroscopy and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry data showing that the probabilistic formulations are more robust to noise and model order misspecification. The probabilistic PARAFAC2, thus, forms a promising framework for modeling multi-way data accounting for uncertainty.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Jørgensen","given":"Philip J.

In this paper, it is hypothesized that the core consistency diagnostic, which is currently applied in, for example, PARAFAC1 can be used to determine model complexity in PARAFAC2. Theoretically, a PARAFAC1 model is fitted ‘inside’ the PARAFAC2 algorithm, and it should therefore be possible to apply the core consistency diagnostic from PARAFAC1 in PARAFAC2. To support this hypothesis, three different datasets, as well as simulated datasets, have been evaluated by means of PARAFAC2, and the core consistencies have been investigated. There is a general trend that if the core consistency is low, the model is overfitted as in PARAFAC1. Also, core consistency captures the true variation in the data, whereas small peaks are easily overlooked by visual inspection of noisy models. However, for determining the number of components in a PARAFAC2 model, we suggest usage of the core consistency in combination with other model parameters such as residuals, loadings, and split‐half analysis.

Improve-ments in sample preparation techniques in the last two decades have resulted in efficient extraction, cleanup, and preconcentration in a single step, thus providing a pathway to tackle complex matrix appli-cations. Applications such as biological therapeutics, proteomics, lipidomics, metabolomics, environmen-tal/industrial hygiene, forensics, glycan cleanup, etc., have been significantly enhanced due to improved sample preparation techniques. This review looks at the early sample preparation techniques. Further, it describes eight sample preparation technique coupled to HPLC that has gained prominence in the last two decades. They are (1) solid-phase extraction (SPE), (2) liquid-liquid extraction (LLE), (3) gel perme-ation chromatography (GPC), (4) Quick Easy Cheap Effective Rugged, Safe (QuEChERS), (5) solid-phase microextraction (SPME), (6) ultrasonic-assisted solvent extraction (UASE), and (7) microwave-assisted sol-vent extraction (MWASE). SPE, LLE, GPC, QuEChERS, and SPME can be used offline and online with HPLC. UASE and MWASE can be used offline with HPLC but have also been combined with the online automated techniques of SPE, LLE, GPC, or QuEChERS for targeted analysis. Three application areas of biomedical, forensics, and environmental/industrial hygiene are reviewed for the eight sample preparation techniques. Three hundred and twenty references on the eight sample preparation techniques published over the last two decades (2001-2021) are provided. Other older references were included to illustrate the historical development of sample preparation techniques. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

These phases included C18 and C18 Aqua stationary phases, as well as three phenyl phases: Propyl-phenyl, Synergi polar-RP and Cosmosil 5PBB phase. Overall, the results revealed that the phenyl-type columns offered better separation performance for the linear PAHs, while the separation of the structural isomer PAHs was enhanced on the C18 columns. The Propyl-phenyl column was found to have the highest molecular-stationary phase interactions, as evidenced by the greatest rate of change in 'S' (0.71) as a function of the molecular weight in the PAH homologous series, despite having the lowest surface coverage (3% carbon load) (where S is the slope of a plot of log k versus the solvent composition). In contrast, the C18 Aqua column, having the highest surface coverage (15% carbon load) was found to have the second lowest molecular-stationary phase interactions (rate of change in S=0.61). Interestingly, the Synergi polar-RP column, which also is a phenyl stationary phase behaved more 'C18-like' than 'phenyl-like' in many of the tests undertaken. This is probably not unexpected since all five phases were reversed phase.

Current methods have been well studied and adopted for decades and have assisted researchers in obtaining reliable results. However, these methods rely on relatively simple statistics of the data (chromatograms) which in some cases result in significant information loss and inaccuracies. In this study, a deep one-dimensional convolutional autoencoder was developed that simultaneously removes baseline noise and baseline drift with minimal information loss, for a large number and great variety of chromatograms. To enable the autoencoder to denoise a chromatogram to be almost, or completely, noise-free, it was trained on data obtained from an implemented chromatogram simulator that generated 190.000 representative simulated chromatograms. The trained autoencoder was then tested and compared to some of the most widely used and well-established denoising methods on testing datasets of tens of thousands of simulated chromatograms; and then further tested and verified on real chromatograms. The results show that the developed autoencoder can successfully remove baseline noise and baseline drift simultaneously with minimal information loss; outperforming methods like Savitzky-Golay smoothing, Gaussian smoothing and wavelet smoothing for baseline noise reduction (root mean squared error of 1.094 mAU compared to 2.074 mAU, 2.394 mAU and 2.199 mAU) and Savitkzy-Golay smoothing combined with asymmetric least-squares or polynomial fitting for baseline noise and baseline drift reduction (root mean absolute error of 1.171 mAU compared to 3.397 mAU and 4.923 mAU). Evidence is presented that autoencoders can be utilized to enhance and correct chromatograms and consequently improve and alleviate downstream data analysis, with the drawback of needing a carefully implemented simulator, that generates realistic chromatograms, to train the autoencoder.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Kensert","given":"Alexander"},{"family":"Collaerts","given":"Gilles"},{"family":"Efthymiadis","given":"Kyriakos"},{"family":"Van Broeck","given":"Peter"},{"family":"Desmet","given":"Gert"},{"family":"Cabooter","given":"Deirdre"}],"citation-key":"kensert_2021","container-title":"Journal of Chromatography A","container-title-short":"Journal of Chromatography A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2021.462093","ISSN":"0021-9673","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6,7]]},"page":"462093","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Deep convolutional autoencoder for the simultaneous removal of baseline noise and baseline drift in chromatograms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002196732100217X","volume":"1646"},{"id":"keogh_2001","abstract":"1 Introduction\nTime series are a ubiquitous form of data occurring in virtually every scientific discipline. A common task with time series data is comparing one sequence with another. In some domains a very simple distance measure, such as Euclidean distance will suffice. However, it is often the case that two sequences have the approximately the same overall component shapes, but these shapes do not line up in X-axis. Figure 1 shows this with a simple example. In order to find the similarity between such sequences, or as a preprocessing step before averaging them, we must “warp” the time axis of one (or both) sequences to achieve a better alignment. Dynamic time warping (DTW), is a technique for efficiently achieving this warping. In addition to data mining (Keogh & Pazzani 2000, Yi et. al. 1998, Berndt & Clifford 1994), DTW has been used in gesture recognition (Gavrila & Davis 1995), robotics (Schmill et. al 1999), speech processing (Rabiner & Juang 1993), manufacturing (Gollmer & Posten 1995) and medicine (Caiani et. al 1998).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Keogh","given":"Eamonn J."},{"family":"Pazzani","given":"Michael J."}],"citation-key":"keogh_2001","collection-title":"Proceedings","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2001 SIAM International Conference on Data Mining (SDM)","DOI":"10.1137/1.9781611972719.1","ISBN":"978-0-89871-495-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001",4,5]]},"page":"1-11","publisher":"Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics","source":"epubs.siam.org (Atypon)","title":"Derivative Dynamic Time Warping","type":"chapter","URL":"https://epubs.siam.org/doi/10.1137/1.9781611972719.1"},{"id":"keogh_parameterfreedatamining_2004","abstract":"The Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) distance measure is a technique that has long been known in speech recognition community.

In this study, for the ﬁrst time, we demonstrate the efﬁciency of the multi-way decomposition method PARAllel FACtor analysis 2 (PARAFAC2) for exploring complex LC–MS data. PARAFAC2 enabled automated resolution and quantiﬁcation of several elusive chromatographic peaks (e.g. overlapped, elution time shifted and low s/n ratio), which could not be detected and quantiﬁed by conventional chromatographic data analysis. Raw LC–MS data of 127 F2 B. vulgaris plants were arranged in a three-way array (elution time point × mass spectra × samples), divided into 17 different chromatographic intervals and each interval were individually modeled by PARAFAC2. Three main outputs of the PARAFAC2 models described: (1) elution time proﬁle, (2) relative abundance, and (3) pure mass spectra of the resolved peaks modeled from each interval of the chromatographic data. PARAFAC2 scores corresponding to relative abundances of the resolved peaks were extracted and further used for correlation and partial least squares (PLS) analysis. A total of 71 PARAFAC2 components (which correspond to actual peaks, baselines and tails of neighboring peaks) were modeled from 17 different chromatographic retention time intervals of the LC–MS data. In addition to four previously known saponins, correlation- and PLS-analysis resolved ﬁve unknown saponin-like compounds that were signiﬁcantly correlated with insect resistance. The method also enabled a good separation between resistant and susceptible F2 plants. PARAFAC2 spectral loadings corresponding to the pure mass spectra of chromatographic peaks matched well with experimentally recorded mass spectra (correlation based similarity >95%). This enabled to extract pure mass spectra of highly overlapped and low s/n ratio peaks.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Khakimov","given":"Bekzod"},{"family":"Amigo","given":"José Manuel"},{"family":"Bak","given":"Søren"},{"family":"Engelsen","given":"Søren Balling"}],"citation-key":"khakimov_plantmetabolomicsresolution_2012","container-title":"Journal of Chromatography A","container-title-short":"Journal of Chromatography A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2012.10.023","ISSN":"00219673","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",11]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"84-94","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Plant metabolomics: Resolution and quantification of elusive peaks in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry profiles of complex plant extracts using multi-way decomposition methods","title-short":"Plant metabolomics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021967312015786","volume":"1266"},{"id":"khanacademy.MultiplyingMatrices.2016","citation-key":"khanacademy.MultiplyingMatrices.2016","director":[{"family":"KhanAcademy","given":""}],"issued":{"date-parts":[["2016"]]},"title":"Multiplying Matrices","type":"motion_picture","URL":"https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/x9e81a4f98389efdf:matrices/x9e81a4f98389efdf:multiplying-matrices-by-matrices/a/multiplying-matrices"},{"id":"kiers_parafac2parti_1999","abstract":"PARAFAC is a generalization of principal component analysis (PCA) to the situation where a set of data matrices is to be analysed. If each data matrix has the same row and column units, the resulting data are three-way data and can be modelled by the PARAFAC1 model. If each data matrix has the same column units but different (numbers of) row units, the PARAFAC2 model can be used. Like the PARAFAC1 model, the PARAFAC2 model gives unique solutions under certain mild assumptions, whereas it is less severely constrained than PARAFAC1. It may therefore also be used for regular three-way data in situations where the PARAFAC1 model is too restricted. Usually the PARAFAC2 model is ﬁtted to a set of matrices with cross-products between the column units. However, this model-ﬁtting procedure is computationally complex and inefﬁcient. In the present paper a procedure for ﬁtting the PARAFAC2 model directly to the set of data matrices is proposed. It is shown that this algorithm is more efﬁcient than the indirect ﬁtting algorithm. Moreover, it is more easily adjusted so as to allow for constraints on the parameter matrices, to handle missing data, as well as to handle generalizations to sets of three- and higher-way data. Furthermore, with the direct ﬁtting approach we also gain information on the row units, in the form of ‘factor scores’. As will be shown, this elaboration of the model in no way limits the feasibility of the method. Even though full information on the row units becomes available, the algorithm is based on the usually much smaller cross-product matrices only.

Most industries have come up with new brands to not only retain consumers but also to attract new ones. Such industries also acknowledge that repeat customers play an important role as such consumers are willing to spend more, purchase frequently, seek for more information, are more resilient to rival‟s promotions and are more likely to spread positive and constructive information about the brand. The instant coffee brand in Kenya has seen a lot of progress and rivalry, with the growth of many producers and coffee brands. The goal of every firm is to be in the lead over their rivals in every phase and dimension of the competition. To attain this, they have to take on strategies to successfully and efficiently achieve brand loyalty within their industry. Active response is expected among firms as a solution to deal with the effects of variation and competition in their environment. This study therefore sought to investigate the influence of pricing, packaging and brand awareness on brand loyalty in instant coffee brands among supermarkets customers within the Nairobi Central Business District (NCBD). The population of study comprised of 10 supermarkets licensed as large retailers operating within the Nairobi Central Business District. A semi structured questionnaire was used to collect primary data for this study. The data collected in this study using the questionnaire was prepared for analysis. This study adopted the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) computer software. The study used two statistical tests that is Descriptive Statistics and regression analysis. Descriptive Statistics was used to analyze the background information and to examine the existence of co-relationships between variables. To investigate the effect brand awareness and packaging price had on the brand loyalty of supermarkets customer‟s found in Nairobi Central Business District (NCBD), regression analysis was used. From the study findings, the study concludes that brand awareness, attractive packaging and reasonable pricing positively influence brand loyalty of a product. The study findings revealed that consumers are moved to buy a product when they see advertisement of their preferred brand. The study thus concludes that advertising creates awareness of a product and thus improves the customer loyalty. The study further concludes that availability of different packaging sizes with different prices attracts more attention to consumers compared to a brand that has only one packaging size.","author":[{"family":"Kimani","given":"Ruth W"}],"citation-key":"kimani_InfluenceMarketingStrategy_2015","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"89","publisher":"KCA University","source":"Zotero","title":"The Influence Of Marketing Strategy On Brand Loyalty Of Instant Coffee Brands: A Case Of Supermarket Customers In Nairobi","type":"thesis","URL":"http://41.89.49.13:8080/xmlui/handle/123456789/1206"},{"id":"kimball_datawarehousetoolkit_2013","author":[{"family":"Kimball","given":"Ralph"},{"family":"Ross","given":"Margy"}],"call-number":"QA76.9.D26 K575 2013","citation-key":"kimball_datawarehousetoolkit_2013","edition":"Third edition","event-place":"Indianapolis, IN","ISBN":"978-1-118-53080-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"note":"OCLC: ocn840431951","number-of-pages":"564","publisher":"John Wiley & Sons, Inc","publisher-place":"Indianapolis, IN","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"The data warehouse toolkit: the definitive guide to dimensional modeling","title-short":"The data warehouse toolkit","type":"book"},{"id":"kirkland_FusedcoreParticleTechnology_2013","abstract":"The advent of superficially porous particles (SPPs) for packed HPLC columns has changed the way that many practitioners have approached the problem of developing needed separations.

While the conventional UHPLC columns produced more theoretical plates at the optimum flow rate, when separations were performed at maximum through-put the larger particle size AFT column out-performed the UHPLC column. When both the AFT column and the UHPLC column were operated such that they yielded the same number of theoretical plates per separation, the separation on the AFT column was twice as fast as that on the UHPLC column, with the same level of sensitivity and at just 70% of the back pressure. Furthermore, as the flow velocity further increased the performance gain on the AFT column compared to the UHPLC column improved. An additional advantage of the AFT column was that the flow stream at the exit of the column was split in the radial cross section of the peak profile. This enables the AFT column to be coupled to a flow limiting detector, such as a mass spectrometer.

In liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) method development, accurate peak detection is crucial to producing reliable results. Noise in the chromatogram, among other things, can make peak detection challenging. In this Master’s thesis, a literature review of peak detection and integration methods is presented, as well as methods used to estimate noise in the chromatogram signal prior to peak detection. A novel framework for detecting chromatographic peaks that uses theoretical peak shapes is also introduced. The second part of this thesis consists of a case study where the goal is to reduce the relative standard deviation of the integrated peak areas, since this parameter correlates with the method performance. A peak detection and integration framework was developed and applied to data sets produced with the LC/MS method. The framework had a couple of options for estimating noise in the chromatogram data and detecting the start and end points of the peak. The methods for detecting the start and end points of peaks is based on fitting a theoretical peak to the chromatograms. The relative standard deviations obtained with the framework are compared to the relative standard deviations obtained with a known peak detection method from the literature and to the currently used method in the analyzers. The proposed framework performed well compared to the other methods, despite the noise in the data and the varying peak shapes. In most of the analysed data sets, the proposed framework was able to produce lower relative standard deviations of the integrated areas. It was concluded that fitting a theoretical peak improved the precision of the detection and integration of chromatographic peaks.","author":[{"family":"Kuikka","given":"Juho"}],"citation-key":"kuikka_2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"Detection and integration of chromatographic peaks using theoretical peak fitting","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"kumler_pickypeakpickingassessing_2023","abstract":"Background: Chromatographic peakpicking continues to represent a significant bottleneck in automated LC–MS workflows. Uncontrolled false discovery rates and the lack of manually-calibrated quality metrics require researchers to visually evaluate individual peaks, requiring large amounts of time and breaking replicability. This problem is exacerbated in noisy environmental datasets and for novel separation methods such as hydrophilic interaction columns in metabolomics, creating a demand for a simple, intuitive, and robust metric of peak quality.\nResults: Here, we manually labeled four HILIC oceanographic particulate metabolite datasets to assess the performance of individual peak quality metrics. We used these datasets to construct a predictive model calibrated to the likelihood that visual inspection by an MS expert would include a given mass feature in the downstream analysis. We implemented two novel peak quality metrics, a custom signal-to-noise metric and a test of similarity to a bell curve, both calculated from the raw data in the extracted ion chromatogram, and found that these outperformed existing measurements of peak quality. A simple logistic regression model built on two metrics reduced the fraction of false positives in the analysis from 70–80% down to 1–5% and showed minimal overfitting when applied to novel datasets. We then explored the implications of this quality thresholding on the conclusions obtained by the downstream analysis and found that while only 10% of the variance in the dataset could be explained by depth in the default output from the peakpicker, approximately 40% of the variance was explained when restricted to high-quality peaks alone.\nConclusions: We conclude that the poor performance of peakpicking algorithms significantly reduces the power of both univariate and multivariate statistical analyses to detect environmental differences. We demonstrate that simple models built on intuitive metrics and derived from the raw data are more robust and can outperform more complex models when applied to new data. Finally, we show that in properly curated datasets, depth is a major driver of variability in the marine microbial metabolome and identify several interesting metabolite trends for future investigation.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Kumler","given":"William"},{"family":"Hazelton","given":"Bryna J."},{"family":"Ingalls","given":"Anitra E."}],"citation-key":"kumler_pickypeakpickingassessing_2023","container-title":"BMC Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"BMC Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1186/s12859-023-05533-4","ISSN":"1471-2105","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,28]]},"language":"en","page":"404","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Picky with peakpicking: assessing chromatographic peak quality with simple metrics in metabolomics","title-short":"Picky with peakpicking","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://bmcbioinformatics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12859-023-05533-4","volume":"24"},{"id":"kunapuli_2023","author":[{"family":"Kunapuli","given":"Gautam"}],"citation-key":"kunapuli_2023","event-place":"Shelter Island, NY","ISBN":"978-1-61729-713-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"330","publisher":"Manning","publisher-place":"Shelter Island, NY","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Ensemble methods for machine learning","type":"book"},{"id":"kuo2011","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Kuo","given":"J.-W."},{"family":"Prestwich","given":"G.D."}],"citation-key":"kuo2011","container-title":"Comprehensive Biomaterials","DOI":"10.1016/B978-0-08-055294-1.00073-8","ISBN":"978-0-08-055294-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"language":"en","page":"239-259","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Hyaluronic Acid","type":"chapter","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/B9780080552941000738"},{"id":"kusznierewicz-ApplicationCommerciallyAvailable-2011","abstract":"This study demonstrates the potential of a commercially available derivatization instrument coupled with HPLC for separation and on-line determination of antioxidants detected with widely used screening reagents-DPPH (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl), ABTS (2,2'-azinobis-(3-ethylbenzthiazoline-6-sulphonic acid)) or FCR (Folin-Ciocalteu's phenol reagent).

This requirement can be fulfilled with the recently proposed HPLC-post-column derivatisation approach, enabling rapid measurements of antioxidative potential along with profiling antioxidants in complex mixtures. Objective - To employ the commercially available post-column derivatisation device for the on-line detection of antioxidants and to optimise analytical parameters enabling its application for routine profiling of antioxidants in complex mixtures such as those of plant or food origin. Methodology - The mixtures of standards and fruit extracts were resolved using an optimised HPLC method followed by the on-line derivatisation of analytes in a PCX post-column derivatisation instrument. Such parameters as the type of indicator reagent (ABTS, DPPH, Folin-Ciocalteu), its concentration and the temperature of the derivatisation reaction were investigated. The determinations of the Trolox equivalents (TE) values were compared with those obtained by corresponding bulk spectrophotometric tests. Results - The study confirms that the commercial HPLC-coupled post-column derivatisation instruments are suitable for routine on-line detection of antioxidants in complex mixtures and the determination of their TE values. The analytical parameters optimised here appear to represent a ready-to-use toolbox for the food and pharmaceutical industries, enabling the monitoring of bioactive substances along the production line and during storage, and the characterisation of plant material by creating chromatographic profiles supplemented with antioxidant fingerprints. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","archive":"Scopus","author":[{"family":"Kusznierewicz","given":"B."},{"family":"Piasek","given":"A."},{"family":"Bartoszek","given":"A."},{"family":"Namiesnik","given":"J."}],"citation-key":"kusznierewicz2011a","container-title":"Phytochemical Analysis","DOI":"10.1002/pca.1294","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"392-402","source":"Scopus","title":"The optimisation of analytical parameters for routine profiling of antioxidants in complex mixtures by HPLC coupled post-column derivatisation","type":"article-journal","volume":"22"},{"id":"lacalle-bergeron_chromatographyhyphenatedhigh_2021","author":[{"family":"Lacalle-Bergeron","given":"Leticia"},{"family":"Izquierdo-Sandoval","given":"David"},{"family":"Sancho","given":"Juan V."},{"family":"Lopez","given":"Francisco J."},{"family":"Hernandez","given":"Felix"},{"family":"Portoles","given":"Tania"}],"citation-key":"lacalle-bergeron_chromatographyhyphenatedhigh_2021","container-title":"TRAC-TRENDS IN ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY","DOI":"10.1016/j.trac.2020.116161","ISSN":"0165-9936","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",2]]},"number":"116161","title":"Chromatography hyphenated to high resolution mass spectrometry in untargeted metabolomics for investigation of food (bio)markers","type":"article-journal","volume":"135"},{"id":"lafuente","author":[{"family":"Lafuente","given":"Deborah"},{"family":"Cohen","given":"Brenda"},{"family":"Fiorini","given":"Guillermo"},{"family":"García","given":"Agustín"},{"family":"Bringas","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Onna","given":"Diego"}],"citation-key":"lafuente","language":"en","page":"14","source":"Zotero","title":"Introduction to Machine Learning for chemists: An undergraduate course using Python notebooks for visualization, data processing, data analysis, and data modeling","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"lafuente.GentleIntroductionMachine.2021","abstract":"Machine learning, a subdomain of artificial intelligence, is a widespread technology that is molding how chemists interact with data.

Identifying the source responsible for a pollution hot spot is vital for assessing remediation measures, however, as there are many possible sources of environmental PFAS pollution, this can be challenging. Chemical fingerprinting has been proposed as an approach to identify contamination sources. Here, concentrations and profiles (relative distribution profiles) of routinely targeted PFAS in freshwater fish from eight sites in Norway, representing three different sources: (1) production of paper products, (2) the use of aqueous film forming foams (AFFF), and (3) long-range atmospheric transport, were investigated. The data were retrieved from published studies. Results showed that fingerprinting of PFAS in fish can be used to identify the dominant exposure source(s), and the profiles associated with the different sources were described in detail. Based on the results, the liver was concluded to be better suited for source tracking compared to muscle. PFAS fingerprints originating from AFFF were dominated by perfluorooctanesulfonate (PFOS) and other perfluoroalkanesulfonic acids (PFSA). Fingerprints originating from both long-range atmospheric transport and production of paper products were associated with high percentages of long chained perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCA). However, there were differences between the two latter sources with respect to the n-ary sumation PFAS concentrations and ratios of specific PFCA pairs (PFUnDA/PFDA and PFTrDA/PFDoDA). Low n-ary sumation PFAS concentrations were detected in fish exposed mainly to PFAS via long-range atmospheric transport. In contrast, n-ary sumation PFAS concentrations were high and high percentages of PFOS were detected in fish exposed to pollution from production of paper products. The source-specific fingerprints described here can be used for source tracking.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Langberg","given":"Hakon A."},{"family":"Hale","given":"Sarah E."},{"family":"Breedveld","given":"Gijs D."},{"family":"Jenssen","given":"Bjorn M."},{"family":"Jartun","given":"Morten"}],"citation-key":"langberg_ReviewPFASFingerprints_2022","container-title":"Environmental Science-Processes & Impacts","container-title-short":"Environ.

An analytical method was developed to monitor various nitro(so) compounds including N-nitrosamines based on the Griess colorimetric determination of nitrite generated by UV-254 nm photolysis of nitro(so) compounds after separation by HPLC (HPLC-Post Column UV photolysis/Griess reaction (HPLC-PCUV)). To differentiate N-nitro(so) compounds (i.e. UV-labile) from other nitro(so) and N-containing compounds (i.e. UV-resistant), a pre-treatment was established by photolyzing solid-phase extracted samples at 254 nm (1000 mJ/cm2) and thus removing N-nitro(so) compounds selectively. Considering a 1000-fold concentration factor and extraction efficiencies (57–83%) during solid phase extraction, the method detection limits ranged from 4 to 28 ng/L for dimethylnitramine and eight N-nitrosamines (EPA 8270 nine nitrosamines mixture except for N-nitrosodiphenylamine). For four pool waters, the UV-resistant groups accounted for more than 78% of the estimated total concentration of nitro(so) and other N-containing compounds (6.1–48.6 nM). Only one unknown UV-labile compound was detected in one pool water (2.0–7.9 nM). NDMA was most frequently detected and N-nitrosodipropylamine (NDPA) and N-nitrosodibutylamine (NDBA) were additionally detected in one pool water. Chloramination of a secondary wastewater effluent with NDMA (0.2 nM) and UV-resistant compounds (7.9 nM) from a pilot-scale municipal wastewater treatment plant led to a significant formation of not only unidentified UV-resistant compounds (67.8 nM) and UV-labile compounds (14.6 nM), but also identified nitrosamines such as NDMA (4.3 nM), N-nitrosopiperidine (1.8 nM), NDPA (0.5 nM), and NDBA (0.5 nM). Overall, the novel HPLC-PCUV system is a powerful screening tool for the detection of (un)known N-nitro(so) as well as other nitro(so) and UV-induced nitrite-producing compounds.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Lee","given":"Minju"},{"family":"Lee","given":"Yunho"},{"family":"Soltermann","given":"Fabian"},{"family":"Gunten","given":"Urs","non-dropping-particle":"von"}],"citation-key":"lee2013","container-title":"Water Research","container-title-short":"Water Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.watres.2013.05.031","ISSN":"0043-1354","issue":"14","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,15]]},"language":"en","page":"4893-4903","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Analysis of N-nitrosamines and other nitro(so) compounds in water by high-performance liquid chromatography with post-column UV photolysis/Griess reaction","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0043135413004399","volume":"47"},{"id":"legoff2015","abstract":"The constantly increasing requests for the measurement of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D over the last years has led reagent manufacturers to market different automated and semi-automated methods, that being unfortunately not fully harmonized, yield different results.

This approach allows the distinction between the two forms of 25-hydroxyvitamin D and to measure other metabolites. This approach also requires harmonization to curtail the differences between the different analytical methods.

Sensory studies have indicated that different grapegrowing regions in Australia produce distinct styles of Shiraz wines that differ in flavour characteristics. The current project aimed to characterise the underlying volatile composition associated with regional Shiraz wine styles. Methods and Results: Wines were selected from six geographically distinct regions and the volatile compounds were analysed using gas chromatography time-of-flight mass spectrometry to provide a comprehensive and holistic overview of the wine volatilome. A suite of R language based software enabled feature extraction and importance ranking, following an untargeted metabolomics approach. A classification model based on the random forests algorithm using the 80 most important compounds correctly associated all samples to regions. A range of these compounds, including terpenoids, benzenoids, esters, furan derivatives and aliphatic alcohols, has been associated with grape composition, winemaking influences and the ageing process. Conclusions: The results suggest that the regional compositional differences in varietal wines may be influenced by all processes in the entire wine production chain. Significance of the Study: The current study highlighted the chemical basis underlying the regional typicality of Australian Shiraz wines, and identified specific volatile compounds that may be associated with a region.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,5]]},"author":[{"family":"LI","given":"S."},{"family":"BLACKMAN","given":"J.

As HM occupies an important position in its own right in global healthcare systems, robust quality assessment and control over its complex chemical composition was of great significance to assure its efficacy and safety. Over the past decades, the concept of HM chemical fingerprints aiming to obtain a comprehensive characterization of complex chemical matrices has become one of the most convincing tools for the quality assessment of HM. This review summarizes the recent analytical techniques used to generate HM chemical fingerprints, including chromatography, vibrational spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The advantages, drawbacks, and the application scope of each technology have been scrutinized in an attempt to better understand the data analysis. Furthermore, HM fingerprints together with multivariate and multiway chemometrics methods used for different application domains, such as similarity, exploratory, classification, and regression analysis, have also been discussed and illustrated with a few typical studies.

Gold catalysts, with unique electronic properties and catalytic abilities, have elevated versatile reaction modes through πinteraction induced activation. On the basis of increasing research interest in this topic, together with the signiﬁcant development of various ligands, including phosphine ligands and azacyclic or noncyclic carbene ligands, the understanding of the catalytic function of gold catalysts has become much deeper and more comprehensive. Diﬀerent reaction needs thus could be adapted by a novel gold catalyst with a diversiﬁed ligand selection. Furthermore, the whole evolution of the gold catalysis on synthetic methodologies has realized and expanded its application into natural product synthesis as well as the potentiality of drug discovery, which endows this ancient metal with a magniﬁcent renaissance. The reactivity of strained small ring molecules with high tension has always been an important research topic in organic chemistry. When the highly strained small ring is linked with a π-electron rich moiety or contains a heteroatom, the gold activation of the π-system or coordination with the heteroatom can initiate a cascade reaction, usually followed by ring opening or expansion. These processes can result in the rapid construction of complex and distinct molecular structures, many of which feature in biologically important molecules. In this review, we will mainly summarize the advances on diverse reaction types and molecular constructions accomplished by homogeneous gold catalysis using highly strained substrates, including methylenecyclopropanes (MCPs), vinylidenecyclopropanes (VDCPs), cyclopropenes as well as aziridine- and epoxide-containing molecules, focusing on the last 10 years. For functionalized alkynyl cyclopropanes, several early inspiring and elegant examples will be described in this review for systematically understanding these transformations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Li","given":"Deyao"},{"family":"Zang","given":"Wenqing"},{"family":"Bird","given":"Melissa J."},{"family":"Hyland","given":"Christopher J.

A dii approach, which assumes local symmetry in the proximity of the chromatographic peak maximum of the major analyte, and an optimization approach using the estimated peak maximum of the major analyte as objective function.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Liang","given":"Yi-zeng"},{"family":"Kvalheim","given":"Olav M."}],"citation-key":"liang-UniqueResolutionHidden-1993","container-title":"Analytica Chimica Acta","container-title-short":"Analytica Chimica Acta","DOI":"10.1016/0003-2670(93)80414-G","ISSN":"00032670","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1993",4]]},"language":"en","page":"425-440","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Unique resolution of hidden minor peaks in multidetection chromatography by first-order differentiation and orthogonal projections","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/000326709380414G","volume":"276"},{"id":"liberti_EuclideanDistanceGeometry_2017","author":[{"family":"Liberti","given":"Leo"},{"family":"Lavor","given":"Carlile"}],"citation-key":"liberti_EuclideanDistanceGeometry_2017","event-place":"New York, NY","ISBN":"978-3-319-60791-7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"publisher":"Springer Berlin Heidelberg","publisher-place":"New York, NY","source":"Library of Congress ISBN","title":"Euclidean distance geometry","type":"book"},{"id":"liebal_machinelearningapplications_2020","abstract":"The metabolome of an organism depends on environmental factors and intracellular regulation and provides information about the physiological conditions. Metabolomics helps to understand disease progression in clinical settings or estimate metabolite overproduction for metabolic engineering. The most popular analytical metabolomics platform is mass spectrometry (MS). However, MS metabolome data analysis is complicated, since metabolites interact nonlinearly, and the data structures themselves are complex. Machine learning methods have become immensely popular for statistical analysis due to the inherent nonlinear data representation and the ability to process large and heterogeneous data rapidly. In this review, we address recent developments in using machine learning for processing MS spectra and show how machine learning generates new biological insights. In particular, supervised machine learning has great potential in metabolomics research because of the ability to supply quantitative predictions. We review here commonly used tools, such as random forest, support vector machines, artificial neural networks, and genetic algorithms. During processing steps, the supervised machine learning methods help peak picking, normalization, and missing data imputation. For knowledge-driven analysis, machine learning contributes to biomarker detection, classification and regression, biochemical pathway identification, and carbon flux determination. Of important relevance is the combination of different omics data to identify the contributions of the various regulatory levels. Our overview of the recent publications also highlights that data quality determines analysis quality, but also adds to the challenge of choosing the right model for the data. Machine learning methods applied to MS-based metabolomics ease data analysis and can support clinical decisions, guide metabolic engineering, and stimulate fundamental biological discoveries.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Liebal","given":"Ulf W."},{"family":"Phan","given":"An N.

Guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and cancers discourage alcohol consumption in any form, but several studies have demonstrated that low RW intake may have positive effects on CVD risk. This review evaluated randomised controlled trials (RCTs), examining the recent literature on the correlations between acute and chronic RW consumption and health. All RCTs published in English on PubMed from 1 January 2000 to 28 February 2023 were evaluated. Ninety-one RCTs were included in this review, seven of which had a duration of more than six months. We assessed the effect of RW on: (1) antioxidant status, (2) cardiovascular function, (3) coagulation pathway and platelet function, (4) endothelial function and arterial stiffness, (5) hypertension, (6) immune function and inflammation status, (7) lipid profile and homocysteine levels, (8) body composition, type 2 diabetes and glucose metabolism, and (9) gut microbiota and the gastrointestinal tract. RW consumption mostly results in improvements in antioxidant status, thrombosis and inflammation markers, lipid profile, and gut microbiota, with conflicting results on hypertension and cardiac function. Notably, beneficial effects were observed on oxidative stress, inflammation, and nephropathy markers, with a modest decrease in CVD risk in five out of seven studies that evaluated the effect of RW consumption. These studies were conducted mainly in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, and had a duration between six months and two years. Additional long-term RCTs are needed to confirm these benefits, and assess the potential risks associated with RW consumption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Lombardo","given":"Mauro"},{"family":"Feraco","given":"Alessandra"},{"family":"Camajani","given":"Elisabetta"},{"family":"Caprio","given":"Massimiliano"},{"family":"Armani","given":"Andrea"}],"citation-key":"lombardo_HealthEffectsRed_2023","container-title":"Nutrients","container-title-short":"Nutrients","DOI":"10.3390/nu15081921","ISSN":"2072-6643","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,16]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"1921","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Health Effects of Red Wine Consumption: A Narrative Review of an Issue That Still Deserves Debate","title-short":"Health Effects of Red Wine Consumption","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/15/8/1921","volume":"15"},{"id":"lopes_Carbohydratecontentdietary_2016","abstract":"Single-dose coffee capsule system is a technology used to prepare espresso coffee which offers consumers the possibility to choose among several blends. However, the characterization of espresso coffees extracted with these systems, namely regarding polysaccharides structures and melanoidin content, is scarce. In order to define a carbohydrate and melanoidin composition pattern for single-dose espresso coffee base blends, a range of 6 commercial espresso coffee blends was studied. In addition, a decaffeinated blend and a blend supplemented with plant natural extracts were also included. The base blends showed galactomannans as the predominant polysaccharides over arabinogalactans, on the contrary of the decaffeinated blend. The blend supplemented with natural plant extracts showed glucose-rich polysaccharides. The labelled intensity of coffee single-dose seems to be related with the unknown brown compounds of melanoidins, present in the high molecular weight material of the brews. A pattern could be obtained for single-dose espresso coffee base blends, presenting an average per cup of 1.21g of total solids and 242mg of soluble dietary fibre, constituted by 62mg of galactomannans and 48mg of arabinogalactans, and 123mg of melanoidins.

However, unlike other alcoholic beverages, moderate wine drinking has demonstrated a protective effect on the risk of developing several types of cancer.\n\nObjective\nTo analyze the association between wine consumption and the risk of developing cancer.\n\nMethods\nWe searched the MEDLINE (through PubMed), Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases to conduct this systematic review and meta-analysis. Pooled relative risks (RRs) were calculated using the DerSimonian and Laird methods. I2 was used to evaluate inconsistency, the τ2 test was used to assess heterogeneity, and The Newcastle-Ottawa Quality Assessment Scale were applied to evaluate the risk of bias. This study was previously registered in PROSPERO, with the registration number CRD42022315864.\n\nResults\nSeventy-three studies were included in the systematic review, and 26 were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled RR for the effect of wine consumption on the risk of gynecological cancers was 1.03 (95% CI: 0.99, 1.08), that for colorectal cancer was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.82, 1.03), and that for renal cancer was 0.92 (95% CI: 0.81, 1.04). In general, the heterogeneity was substantial.\n\nConclusion\nThe study findings reveal no association between wine consumption and the risk of developing any type of cancer. Moreover, wine drinking demonstrated a protective trend regarding the risk of developing pancreatic, skin, lung, and brain cancer as well as cancer in general.\n\nSystematic review registration\nhttps://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022315864, identifier CRD42022315864 (PROSPERO).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Lucerón-Lucas-Torres","given":"Maribel"},{"family":"Cavero-Redondo","given":"Iván"},{"family":"Martínez-Vizcaíno","given":"Vicente"},{"family":"Bizzozero-Peroni","given":"Bruno"},{"family":"Pascual-Morena","given":"Carlos"},{"family":"Álvarez-Bueno","given":"Celia"}],"citation-key":"lucerón-lucas-torres_2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Nutrition","container-title-short":"Front Nutr","DOI":"10.3389/fnut.2023.1197745","ISSN":"2296-861X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"page":"1197745","PMCID":"PMC10507274","PMID":"37731399","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Association between wine consumption and cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis","title-short":"Association between wine consumption and cancer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10507274/","volume":"10"},{"id":"ludwig2012","abstract":"The aim of this work was to study the extraction behavior of the main coffee antioxidants (caffeoylquinic acids, melanoidins and caffeine) and the antioxidant capacity, during brewing time in the most widely consumed coffee brew methods (ﬁlter and espresso) in coffee. Antioxidant capacity by colorimetric assays (Folin–Ciocalteau, ABTS and DPPH) and electron spin resonance spectroscopy techniques (Fremy's salt and TEMPO) were analyzed. In espresso coffee, more than 70% of the antioxidants (except dicaffeoylquinic acids, diCQA) of a coffee brew were extracted during the ﬁrst 8 s. In ﬁlter coffee, a U-shape antioxidants extraction proﬁle was observed, starting later (after 75 s) in Vietnam coffee than in Guatemala one, probably due to different wettability. Other technological parameters, such as turbulences and a longer contact time between water and ground coffee in ﬁlter coffeemaker, increased extraction efﬁciency, mainly in less polar antioxidant compounds as diCQA. In conclusion, these technological factors should be considered to optimize coffee antioxidants extraction that can be used as ingredients for functional foods.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ludwig","given":"Iziar A."},{"family":"Sanchez","given":"Lidia"},{"family":"Caemmerer","given":"Bettina"},{"family":"Kroh","given":"Lothar W."},{"family":"De Peña","given":"M.

In this review, the principles and changing process of oak aging and other traditional aging methods were first discussed. Then, improving the aging effect and the influential factors of modern technologies that can simulate oak aging, such as micro-oxygenation, oak products, and coupling technology, etc., are analyzed. In short, using artificial aging technology to shorten the aging time, improve wine quality and reduce production costs and meet market demand has become an inevitable tendency. However, unclear reaction principles and changing process and unstable quality restrict the commercialization of artificial aging technology. Therefore, we identify future research necessary to further clarify, regulate, and optimize artificial aging technologies that perfectly simulate the traditional barrel maturation environment to truly promote applications in the wine industry.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Ma","given":"Tingting"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Jiaqi"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Haoli"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Qinyu"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Fan"},{"family":"Ge","given":"Qian"},{"family":"Li","given":"Caihong"},{"family":"Gamboa","given":"Gastón Gutiérrez"},{"family":"Fang","given":"Yulin"},{"family":"Sun","given":"Xiangyu"}],"citation-key":"ma_2022","container-title":"Food Research International","container-title-short":"Food Research International","DOI":"10.1016/j.foodres.2022.110953","ISSN":"0963-9969","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,1]]},"page":"110953","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Wine aging and artificial simulated wine aging: Technologies, applications, challenges, and perspectives","title-short":"Wine aging and artificial simulated wine aging","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0963996922000102","volume":"153"},{"id":"ma_featureextractionresolution_2016","abstract":"Automatic feature extraction from large-scale datasets is one of the major challenges when analyzing complex samples with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS).\n          , \n            Automatic feature extraction from large-scale datasets is one of the major challenges when analyzing complex samples with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The classic processing pipeline basically consists of noise filtering, baseline correction, peak detection, alignment, normalization and identification. The long pipeline makes the extracted features inconsistent with different methods and values of parameters. In this study, MS-Assisted Resolution of Signals (MARS) has been proposed to extract features automatically from resolution perspective for large-scale GC-MS datasets. Firstly, it divides complex data into small segments and searches the target zone by moving sub-window factor analysis (MSWFA). Then, improved iterative target transformation factor analysis (ITTFA) has been developed to extract features of the compound from complex datasets. MARS was systematically tested on a simulated dataset (5 samples), peppermint dataset (2 samples), red wine dataset (24 samples) and human plasma dataset (131 samples). The results show that MARS can extract features accurately, automatically, objectively and swiftly from these complex datasets at 2–3 minutes/chromatogram speed. The extracted features of overlapped peaks are comparable to the features resolved by MCR-ALS or PARAFAC2, and significantly better than XCMS. Furthermore, PLS-DA models of the human plasma dataset indicated that features extracted automatically by MARS are comparable or better than features extracted manually by experts with a GC-MS workstation.

Existing solutions for analysis often require extensive sample preparation or are limited in terms of detecting different types of integrity issues. We describe a novel authentication method based on Nuclear Quadrupole Resonance (NQR) spectroscopy which is quantitative, non-invasive and non-destructive. It is sensitive to small deviation in the solid-state chemical structure of a product, which changes the NQR signal properties. These characteristics are unique for different manufacturers, resulting in manufacturer-specific watermarks. We show that nominally identical dietary supplements from different manufacturers can be accurately classified based on features from NQR spectra. Specifically, we use a machine learning-based classification called support vector machines (SVMs) to verify the authenticity of products under test.

An open-source and highly extensible codebase is provided to undertake these experiments, demonstrate the viability of the approach on known clusters, and glean insights into the learned representations of chemical space within message-passing neural networks, an architecture not readily permitting interpretability.

This combination\naims to minimize the Plasmodium falciparum resistance which is found when the most frequently\nused drugs are taken individually. Within this context, proguanil hydrochloride and chloroquine\nphosphate which have independent modes of action are taken together to prevent malaria. This paper\naims to develop a fast and powerful analytical method for the simultaneous determination of\nproguanil hydrochloride and chloroquine phosphate in the commercial Paludrine/Avloclor dosage\nforms using a multi-way chromatographic calibration based on high-performance liquid chromatography\nwith diode array detection (HPLC-DAD) and multivariate curve resolution – alternating leastsquares\n(MCR-ALS).\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              A rapid and powerful analytical method based on HPLC-DAD and MCR-ALS was developed\nfor the simultaneous quantification of proguanil hydrochloride and chloroquine phosphate in\nthe commercial Paludrine/Avloclor antimalarial drugs. An isocratic mobile phase composed by 0.2\nM ammonium acetate, acetonitrile, and methanol (40:25:35) and a flow rate of 1.2 mL min-1 were\nemployed in the chromatographic runs with an elution time about 5 min.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              This approach demonstrates that chromatographic analysis may become considerably simpler\nand economical in terms of time, cost, and organic solvent consumption when coupled to multiway\ncalibration models such as MCR-ALS. In fact, this multi-way chromatographic calibration based\non second-order HPLC-DAD data matrices (with extremely low chromatographic resolution) and\nMCR-ALS allows the development of greener analytical methods for complex samples. The proposed\nanalytical method allowed the simultaneous quantification of two antimalarial APIs present in\nthe commercial Paludrine/Avloclor drugs with low REP values below 8% for the simultaneous determination\nof proguanil hydrochloride and chloroquine phosphate.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion:\n              The proposed multi-way chromatographic strategy can be used for routine control of\npharmaceutical dosage forms. It should be highlighted that MCR-ALS allowed to: (a) achieve the second-\norder advantage and the quantification of analytes in the presence of uncalibrated compounds\nsuch as coeluted profile measured in different magnitude of the signal in each successive chromatographic\nrun and significant overlapping profiles and (b) separate the contribution of several components\nfrom chromatographic runs with extremely low separation of peaks through the deconvolution\nof the signal obtained, performing the so-called mathematical chromatography.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Mazivila","given":"Sarmento J."},{"family":"Da Silva","given":"Joaquim C.G.

In this approach, acidic potassium permanganate can react with readily oxidisable compounds (potential antioxidants), post-column, to produce chemiluminescence. Using flow injection analysis, experimental parameters that afforded the most suitable permanganate chemiluminescence signal for a range of known antioxidants were studied in a univariate approach. Optimum conditions were found to be: 1 x 10(-3) M potassium permanganate solution containing 1% (w/v) sodium polyphosphates adjusted to pH 2 with sulphuric acid, delivered at a flow rate of 2.5 mL min(-1) per line. Further investigations showed some differences in detection selectivity between HPLC with the optimised post-column permanganate chemiluminescence detection and DPPH center dot and ABTS assays towards antioxidant standards. However, permanganate chemiluminescence detection was more sensitive. Moreover, screening for antioxidants in green tea, cranberry juice and thyme using potassium permanganate chemiluminescence offers several advantages over the traditional DPPH center dot and ABTS(center dot+) assays, such as faster reagent preparation and superior stability; simpler post-column reaction manifold; and greater compatibility with fast chromatographic separations using monolithic columns.

It is a vital beverage commodity across the world and a valuable export product, ranking second in international trade after petroleum. Ethiopia is among the top ﬁve major coffee-producing countries and is Africa’s leading producer. However, its full production capacity has not yet been exploited, and research efforts to reduce biotic and abiotic factors through reproduction have been extremely limited. Hence, improvement through different breeding methods is essential to overcome the constraints in its production. Thus, the objective of this study is to review the different breeding methods applied for different traits in Ethiopia. Breeding methods depend on the type and the source of traits and the ﬁnal breeding objectives. The main breeding objectives are production, resistance/tolerance to diseases, and cup quality. The commonly applied breeding methods are selected and intra-speciﬁc hybridization, germplasm enhancement, and the development of improved varieties with wider adaptability. There is also a practice of crossing parental lines selected for certain desirable traits for the development of hybrid varieties. Accordingly, some promising success has been obtained. Forty-one coffee varieties have been released so far. Because conventional breeding methods are time-consuming, integrating conventional breeding methods with biotechnological techniques could have an instrumental role in the rapid development of suitable varieties for the changing climate.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Melese","given":"Yebirzaf Yeshiwas"},{"family":"Kolech","given":"Semagn Asredie"}],"citation-key":"melese-CoffeeCoffeaArabica-2021","container-title":"Sustainability","container-title-short":"Sustainability","DOI":"10.3390/su131910814","ISSN":"2071-1050","issue":"19","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,29]]},"language":"en","page":"10814","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Coffee (Coffea arabica L.): Methods, Objectives, and Future Strategies of Breeding in Ethiopia—Review","title-short":"Coffee (Coffea arabica L.)","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/19/10814","volume":"13"},{"id":"mendichi2002","abstract":"Present study concerns SEC fractionation of ultra-high molar mass hyaluronan.

The regulations are particularly severe for wine and include various aspects of the viticulture practices and winemaking techniques. Nevertheless, the use of phenolic profiles for quality control is still fragmented and incomplete, even if they are a promising tool for quality evaluation. Only a few methods have been already validated and widely applied, and an integrated approach is in fact still missing because of the complex dependence of the chemical profile of wine on many viticultural and enological factors, which have not been clarified yet. For example, there is a lack of studies about the phenolic composition in relation to the wine authenticity of white and especially rosé wines. This review is a bibliographic account on the approaches based on phenolic species that have been developed for the evaluation of wine quality and frauds, from the grape varieties (of V. vinifera and non vinifera), to the geographical origin, the vintage year, the winemaking process, and wine aging. Future perspectives on the role of phenolic compounds in different wine quality aspects, which should be still exploited, are also outlined.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Merkytė","given":"Vakarė"},{"family":"Longo","given":"Edoardo"},{"family":"Windisch","given":"Giulia"},{"family":"Boselli","given":"Emanuele"}],"citation-key":"merkytė_PhenolicCompoundsMarkers_2020","container-title":"Foods","DOI":"10.3390/foods9121785","ISSN":"2304-8158","issue":"12","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",12]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"12","page":"1785","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Phenolic Compounds as Markers of Wine Quality and Authenticity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2304-8158/9/12/1785","volume":"9"},{"id":"mermelstein-CoffeeQualityTesting-2012","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Mermelstein","given":"Neil H."}],"citation-key":"mermelstein-CoffeeQualityTesting-2012","container-title":"Food Technology Magazine","issued":{"literal":"janurary 1 2012"},"language":"eng","title":"Coffee Quality Testing","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.ift.org/news-and-publications/food-technology-magazine/issues/2012/january/columns/food-safety-and-quality"},{"id":"merriam-webster.com_DefinitionMOIETY_2024","abstract":"one of two equal parts : half; one of two approximately equal parts; one of the portions into which something is divided : component, part… See the full definition","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Merriam-Webster.com","given":""}],"citation-key":"merriam-webster.com_DefinitionMOIETY_2024","container-title":"Merriam-Webster.com","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","title":"Definition of MOIETY","type":"entry-dictionary","URL":"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/moiety"},{"id":"messenger_1972","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Messenger","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Mandell","given":"Lewis"}],"citation-key":"messenger_1972","container-title":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","container-title-short":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","DOI":"10.1080/01621459.1972.10481290","ISSN":"0162-1459, 1537-274X","issue":"340","issued":{"date-parts":[["1972",12]]},"language":"en","page":"768-772","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A Modal Search Technique for Predictive Nominal Scale Multivariate Analysis","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01621459.1972.10481290","volume":"67"},{"id":"mialon_untargetedmetabolomicapproaches_2023","abstract":"The assessment of food authenticity is a topic that gained a lot of interest at the international level. This term includes misidentification of variety, origin, production system, processing but also adulteration. These frauds all have an analytical component, and research tends to offer new analytical solutions to manage them. One of them is non-targeted approaches, which get around the limitations of targeted analysis by detecting the unexpected. A wide range of products are studied such as wine, rice, olive oil, spices, and honey among the top five. Geographic origin is by far the fraud with the most attention. The main reason is probably the complexity to consider terroir effect and every other variable to determine an area of production.

NMR has proved to be a versatile and robust tool for the identification of adulterants in foods and beverages. Here, we explore the versatility of 1H NMR assisted with chemometric tools, avoiding laborious data analysis, for the quantification of coffee adulteration. Six different adulterants were considered: barley, corn, coffee husks, soybean, rice, and wheat. The NMR-based methodology described here provided satisfactory LOD values (0.31–0.86%) for adul- terants in medium and dark roast coffees. The statistical techniques PCA and SIMCA were employed for pattern recognition and the identification of pure and adulterated samples. Use of the SIMCA model enabled 100% correct classification for both training and prediction sets, ensuring the accuracy, traceability, and reliability of the results.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Milani","given":"Maria Izabel"},{"family":"Rossini","given":"Eduardo Luiz"},{"family":"Catelani","given":"Tiago Augusto"},{"family":"Pezza","given":"Leonardo"},{"family":"Toci","given":"Aline Theodoro"},{"family":"Pezza","given":"Helena Redigolo"}],"citation-key":"milani_Authenticationroastedground_2020","container-title":"Food Control","container-title-short":"Food Control","DOI":"10.1016/j.foodcont.2020.107104","ISSN":"09567135","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",6]]},"language":"en","page":"107104","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Authentication of roasted and ground coffee samples containing multiple adulterants using NMR and a chemometric approach","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0956713520300207","volume":"112"},{"id":"millarová_2017","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Millarová","given":"Petra"}],"citation-key":"millarová_2017","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"title":"Bachelor Thesis: Smoothing of Spectometric Data","type":"thesis","URL":"https://dspace.cvut.cz/bitstream/handle/10467/68743/F1-BP-2017-Millarova-Petra-petra-millarova-bp-2017.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y"},{"id":"miller_earliestknownuses_2012","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,2]]},"author":[{"family":"Miller","given":"Jeff"}],"citation-key":"miller_earliestknownuses_2012","container-title":"Jeff Miller Web Pages","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"title":"Earliest Known Uses of Some of the Words of Mathematics (N)","type":"webpage","URL":"https://jeff560.tripod.com/n.html"},{"id":"miller_EditingDataviewTables_2023","abstract":"Dataview is a wonderful tool, and I recommend it to just about anyone who uses Obsidian.

Kombucha is made via the fermentation of sweetened black tea with a symbiotic culture of bacteria and yeast (SCOBY), which produces acetic acid in addition to a variety of other organic acids and vitamins. The aim of this study was to analyze the acid content of kombucha over a 21-day fermentation period in order to characterize the fermentation kinetics. Titrimetric analysis revealed that the total acidity increased linearly with fermentation time at a rate of 1.5 mM/day. The acetic acid content was also quantified by HPLC at 7-day intervals by standard addition and compared to the total acidity determined by titration. A paired Student’s t test was used to validate the methods. In an extension of the lab, HPLC was also used to identify and quantify the caffeine content of kombucha. The experiments utilized in this study provide a means to characterize beverages and fermentation as well as teach important quantitative and statistical skills.

Results from the two approaches were similar and reflected the complex array of antioxidant species present in the samples. However, some differences in selectivity were observed. Chromatograms generated with the chemiluminescence assay contained more peaks, which was ascribed to the greater sensitivity of the reagent towards minor, readily oxidisable sample components. The three coffee samples produced closely related profiles, signifying their fundamentally similar chemical compositions and origin. Nevertheless, the overall intensity and complexity of the samples in both UV absorption and antioxidant assay chromatograms were aligned with the manufacturers description of flavour intensity and character.

Its main molecular characteristics are molar mass and degree of acetylation (composition). Precise average degrees of acetylation were measured by quantitative 1H solution-state NMR spectroscopy. While number-average degrees of acetylation had already been determined by 1H NMR spectroscopy, weight-average degrees of acetylation are also determined and may be more relevant for some properties, such as mechanical properties. We report the first separation of chitosan according to its degree of acetylation using free solution capillary electrophoresis. Capillary electrophoresis separates chitosan in the ‘critical conditions’: the molar mass plays little role and the separation is by the degree of acetylation. It characterises the heterogeneity of chitosan samples in terms of composition (dispersity of the distribution of degrees of acetylation). This heterogeneity (broad distribution of degrees of acetylation) cannot be neglected contrary to a common assumption found in the literature. This fast and easy separation will allow establishing a structure–property relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Mnatsakanyan","given":"Mariam"},{"family":"Thevarajah","given":"Joel J."},{"family":"Roi","given":"Rozet Sallom"},{"family":"Lauto","given":"Antonio"},{"family":"Gaborieau","given":"Marianne"},{"family":"Castignolles","given":"Patrice"}],"citation-key":"mnatsakanyan2013","container-title":"Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal Bioanal Chem","DOI":"10.1007/s00216-013-7126-4","ISSN":"1618-2650","issue":"21","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8,1]]},"language":"en","page":"6873-6877","source":"Springer Link","title":"Separation of chitosan by degree of acetylation using simple free solution capillary electrophoresis","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1007/s00216-013-7126-4","volume":"405"},{"id":"moehring","abstract":"The concentrations of elemental and volatile components in wine and the effect of biological, meteorological, and anthropogenic factors on their levels are important for authentication and quality assurance.

Principal component analysis separated ORG and CONV coffees but the distinction among the producing regions of Brazilian coffee was not possible. Partial least squares discriminant analysis classified all ORG and CONV coffees in the external validation. Similarly, linear discriminant analysis was able to discriminate 100% and 81% of ORG and CONV coffees in the external validation, respectively, in which total phenolic content (TPC), ferric reducing antioxidant activity, and caffeic acid were the main discriminant variables. Overall 100% of samples from Paraná, Minas Gerais, and blended samples were correctly classified, where TPC, flavonoids, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, caffeic acid, pH, and soluble solids were the main discriminant variables. Support vector machines classified 95% ORG and 88% CONV, 100% Coffea arabica, and 88% and 78% coffees produced in São Paulo and Minas Gerais. k-Nearest neighbors was effective in distinguishing 100% CONV, 89% ORG, 100% coffees from São Paulo, and 100% C. arabica coffees. Overall, HPLC data and simple physicochemical parameters allied to chemometrics were effective in authenticating the cultivation system and the botanical origin of Brazilian coffees. Practical Application Coffee adulteration is a serious problem in the food chain as some fraudsters replace coffee powder by other cheaper products. In the case of organic coffee, this scenario is even worse as still there is not a universal method to differentiate conventionally grown coffee from its organic counterpart. In addition, Brazilian coffee is produced in different regions and the commercial value varies. Therefore, we analyzed some physicochemical, chemical, and antioxidant properties of Brazilian coffees from distinct origins and classified the samples using chemometrics.

Increased wine purchases throughout China have given rise to persistent fraud where fake wines are packaged and sold with counterfeit contents and labels. For exporting countries like France, counterfeit wines displace market share, damage foreign brand reputation, and cause distrust in consumers who are aware of counterfeiting problems throughout the country. We examine the impact of fraudulent wine events (as measured by negative media reports) on Chinese wine demand differentiated by supplying country.

The present paper is a critical presentation of the most important tests used to determine the antioxidant activity, detection mechanism, applicability, advantages and disadvantages of these methods. Out of the tests based on the transfer of a hydrogen atom, the following were presented: the Oxygen Radical Absorption Capacity (ORAC) test, the Hydroxyl Radical Antioxidant Capacity (HORAC) test, the Total Peroxyl Radical Trapping Antioxidant Parameter (TRAP) test, and the Total Oxyradical Scavenging Capacity (TOSC) test. The tests based on the transfer of one electron include the Cupric Reducing Antioxidant Power (CUPRAC) test, the Ferric Reducing Antioxidant Power (FRAP) test, the Folin–Ciocalteu test. Mixed tests, including the transfer of both a hydrogen atom and an electron, include the 2,2′-Azinobis-(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid (ABTS) test, and the [2,2-di(4-tert-octylphenyl)-1-picrylhydrazyl] (DPPH) test. All these assays are based on chemical reactions and assessing the kinetics or reaching the equilibrium state relies on spectrophotometry, presupposing the occurrence of characteristic colours or the discolouration of the solutions to be analysed, which are processes monitored by specific wavelength adsorption. These assays were successfully applied in antioxidant analysis or the determination of the antioxidant capacity of complex samples. As a complementary method in such studies, one may use methods based on electrochemical (bio)sensors, requiring stages of calibration and validation. The use of chemical methods together with electrochemical methods may result in clarification of the operating mechanisms and kinetics of the processes involving several antioxidants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,28]]},"author":[{"family":"Munteanu","given":"Irina Georgiana"},{"family":"Apetrei","given":"Constantin"}],"citation-key":"munteanu_AnalyticalMethodsUsed_2021","container-title":"International Journal of Molecular Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/ijms22073380","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"7","page":"3380","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Analytical Methods Used in Determining Antioxidant Activity: A Review","title-short":"Analytical Methods Used in Determining Antioxidant Activity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1422-0067/22/7/3380","volume":"22"},{"id":"murray-PracticalAIFuzzy-2021","abstract":"“What can we do?”","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Murray","given":"Bryce"}],"citation-key":"murray-PracticalAIFuzzy-2021","container-title":"CodeX","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,18]]},"language":"en","title":"Practical AI — A fuzzy solution.","type":"post-weblog","URL":"https://medium.com/codex/practical-ai-a-fuzzy-solution-beaa6cb79228"},{"id":"mustapha_2016","abstract":"Following the explosive growth in chemical and biological data, the shift from traditional methods of drug discovery to computer-aided means has made data mining and machine learning methods integral parts of today’s drug discovery process.

However, many molecular properties are sensitive to changes in the molecular structure. For this reason, molecules have a mixed distribution for their molecular properties in molecular space, and it consequently makes molecular machine learning difficult. However, this problem has not been investigated in either chemistry or computer science. To tackle this problem, we propose a robust and machine-guided molecular representation based on deep metric learning (DML), which automatically generates an optimal representation for a given dataset. To this end, we first adopt DML for molecular machine learning by integrating it with graph neural networks (GNNs) and devising a new objective function for representation learning. In experimental evaluations, machine learning algorithms with the proposed method achieved better prediction accuracy than state-of-the-art GNNs. Furthermore, the proposed method was also effective on extremely small datasets, and this result is impressive because many real world applications suffer from a lack of training data.","author":[{"family":"Na","given":"Gyoung S."},{"family":"Chang","given":"Hyunju"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Hyun Woo"}],"citation-key":"na","container-title":"Physical Chemistry Chemical Physics","DOI":"10.1039/d0cp02709j","title":"Machine-guided representation for accurate graph-based molecular machine learning","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://feeds.rsc.org/~r/rss/CP/~3/tcmvJFkIy9g/D0CP02709J?utm_source=researcher_app&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=RESR_MRKT_Researcher_inbound"},{"id":"nagy2017","abstract":"This review highlights current techniques for carbohydrate purification and identifies research gaps.\n          , \n            Carbohydrate purification remains a bottleneck in securing analytical standards from natural sources or by chemical or enzymatic synthesis.

Nowadays, one of the principal challenges regarding this kind of analysis is the awkward estimation of the correct chemical rank of the dataset, which represents the total number of pure compounds present in the chemical system. Despite the existence of various algorithms able to focus on this rank evaluation, the method very often used for this task is finally quite simple since it is based on the observation of the eigenvalues generated by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Although this method has shown some potential for rank evaluation, it is still difficult to use it on complex and big datasets or when the signal to noise ratio is relatively weak. In this paper, we introduce a new method, based on the SIMPLE-to-use Self-modeling Mixture Analysis (SIMPLISMA) algorithm that we call Randomised SIMPLISMA. The main idea is thus to use random selections of spectra from the initial dataset and to apply the SIMPLISMA approach to each of them. At the end of this step, all selected spectra are observed using PCA where observed clusters can potentially be highlighted and exploited for the tasks we are interested in. With the present paper, we want to highlight in particular the possibility of an easier rank estimation and initial estimates generation when this approach is considered. Datasets of different complexity acquired with various spectroscopic techniques will be explored in order to evaluate the potential of this approach.","author":[{"family":"Nardecchia","given":"Alessandro"},{"family":"Duponchel","given":"Ludovic"}],"citation-key":"nardecchia_randomisedsimplismausing_2020","container-title":"Talanta","container-title-short":"Talanta","DOI":"10.1016/j.talanta.2020.121024","ISSN":"1873-3573","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",9,1]]},"language":"eng","page":"121024","PMID":"32498871","source":"PubMed","title":"Randomised SIMPLISMA: Using a dictionary of initial estimates for spectral unmixing in the framework of chemical imaging","title-short":"Randomised SIMPLISMA","type":"article-journal","volume":"217"},{"id":"nardini2020","abstract":"Total polyphenols and ﬂavonoids content, phenolics proﬁle by HPLC, and antioxidant activity of ten fruit beer produced adding fruits during the fermentation process were analyzed.

Individuals on the internet began seeking information from other creators and creating their own content. These online communities allowed individuals to communicate across the globe, gravitating toward people like them or those who shared similar beliefs. Conversations around vaccinations have been particularly polarizing across social media even though scientific literature continually validates their safety and effectiveness. This study will explore whether online public discourse about vaccinations changes before and after major scientific publications, and will measure what is related to social engagement around vaccinations on Twitter. In September 2018, two weeks’ worth of Twitter posts (n = 2,919) discussing vaccinations were collected, coded, and analyzed before and after two major 2014 scientific publications. Linear regression analyses examined variables related to engagement with vaccination-related Tweets pre- and postpublication. Antivaccine-related Tweets decreased by over 25% after scientific publications, while provaccine Tweets increased by 16.6%. Regression models suggest verification status and number of followers were the strongest predictors of Twitter engagement. Findings indicate that scientific publications might affect what people public health information people share online, and how people engage with online content. In a time when false information is easily spread online, this study suggests the need for continual scientific publication on “hot topics,” and urges researchers to partner with influential individuals on social media to disseminate effective, evidence-based, and user-friendly public health information to the public.","author":[{"family":"Nelon","given":"Jordan L."},{"family":"Moscarelli","given":"Michael"},{"family":"Stupka","given":"Payton"},{"family":"Sumners","given":"Christina"},{"family":"Uselton","given":"Taylor"},{"family":"Patterson","given":"Megan S."}],"citation-key":"nelon2021","container-title":"Health promotion practice","DOI":"10.1177/1524839919899925","event-place":"Los Angeles, CA","ISSN":"1524-8399","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"eng","page":"377–384","publisher":"SAGE Publications","publisher-place":"Los Angeles, CA","source":"west-sydney-primo.com","title":"Does Scientific Publication Inform Public Discourse?

To make a rigorous and fair comparison, a data generation tool is developed in this work, which utilizes a library of experimental backgrounds, as well as peak shapes obtained from curve fitting on experimental data. Several different distribution functions are used, such as the log-normal, bi-Gaussian, exponentially convoluted Gaussian, exponentially modified Gaussian and modified Pearson VII distributions. The tool was used to create a set of hybrid (part experimental, part simulated) data, in which the background and all peak profiles and areas are known. This large data set (500 chromatograms) was analysed using seven different drift-correction and five different noise-removal algorithms (35 combinations). Root-mean square errors and absolute errors in peak area were determined and it was shown that in most cases the combination of sparsity-assisted signal smoothing and asymmetrically reweighted penalized least-squares resulted in the smallest errors for relatively low-noise signals. However, for noisier signals the combination of sparsity-assisted signal smoothing and a local minimum value approach to background correction resulted in lower absolute errors in peak area. The performance of correction algorithms was studied as a function of the density and coverage of peaks in the chromatogram, shape of the background signal, and noise levels. The developed data-generation tool is published along with this article, so as to allow similar studies with other simulated data sets and possibly other algorithms. The rigorous assessment of correction algorithms in this work may facilitate further automation of data-analysis workflows.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Niezen","given":"Leon E."},{"family":"Schoenmakers","given":"Peter J."},{"family":"Pirok","given":"Bob W.

In addition, a total of 15 isoflavones were simultaneously determined in one single HPLC run with photodiode array detection (DAD), 8 of which were quantified in Radix Puerariae for the first time. Content determination results were used to comprehensively evaluate qualities of Radix Puerariae samples from different natural habitats in China. A YMC™ C18 column (150mm×4.6mm i.d.; 5μm particle size) and gradient elution (acetonitrile and water with 0.02% (v/v) of formic acid) were used during the analysis.

The first investigations into the viability of capillary LC date back to the late 1970s, a decade after the pioneering efforts in HPLC. The drastically reduced column dimensions were required to counter the slow solute diffusion in liquids. There were numerous instrumental difficulties with sample introduction and detection in the picoliter or even femtoliter volumes. High-efficiency separations were needed in the analysis of complex biological mixtures. Miniaturization brought distinct advantages in spectroscopic and electrochemical detection. Since the 1980s, column technologies underwent significant changes: (a) from glass-drawn microcapillaries to slurry-packed, small-diameter fused silica columns; and (b) in microcapillaries packed alternatively with sub-2-mu m particles or monoliths. The viability of LC-MS combination has dramatically promoted the use of small-diameter capillaries. Through \"omics technologies\", capillary LC/tandem MS accounts for most applications in proteomics, glycomics and metabolomics. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Two main varieties, Arabica and Robusta, are produced worldwide. Furthermore, interest of consumers in quality attributes related to coffee production region and varieties is increasing. Thus, it is necessary to encourage the development of simple methodologies to authenticate and guarantee the coffee origin, variety and roasting degree, aiming to prevent fraudulent practices. RESULTS C18 high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection (HPLC-FLD) fingerprints obtained after brewing coffees without any sample treatment other than filtration (i.e. considerably reducing sample manipulation) were employed as sample chemical descriptors for subsequent coffee characterization and classification by principal component analysis (PCA) and partial least squares regression-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). PLS-DA showed good classification capabilities regarding coffee origin, variety and roasting degree when employing HPLC-FLD fingerprints, although overlapping occurred for some sample groups. However, the discrimination power increased when selecting HPLC-FLD fingerprinting segments richer in discriminant features, which were deduced from PLS-DA loading plots. In this case, excellent separation was observed and 100% classification rates for both PLS-DA calibrations and predictions were obtained (all samples were correctly classified within their corresponding groups). CONCLUSION HPLC-FLD fingerprinting segments were3 found to be suitable chemical descriptors for discriminating the origin (country of production), variety (Arabica and Robusta) and roasting degree of coffee.

These effects, which have been supported using cell-based and animal studies, are mainly attributed to epigallocatechin gallate found in green tea, chlorogenic acid in coffee, resveratrol in wine, and curcumin in curry. Polyphenols are proposed to function via various mechanisms, the most important of which is related to reactive oxygen species (ROS). These polyphenols exert conflicting dual actions as anti- and pro-oxidants. Their anti-oxidative actions help scavenge ROS and downregulate nuclear factor-κB to produce favorable anti-inflammatory effects. Meanwhile, pro-oxidant actions appear to promote ROS generation leading to the activation of 5′-AMP-activated protein kinase, which modulates different enzymes and factors with health beneficial roles. Currently, it remains unclear how these polyphenols exert either pro- or anti-oxidant effects. Similarly, several human studies showed no beneficial effects of these foods, and, by extension polyphenols, on obesity. These inconsistencies may be attributed to different confounding study factors. Thus, this review provides a state-of-the-art update on these foods and their principal polyphenol components, with an assumption that it prevents obesity.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Ohishi","given":"Tomokazu"},{"family":"Fukutomi","given":"Ryuuta"},{"family":"Shoji","given":"Yutaka"},{"family":"Goto","given":"Shingo"},{"family":"Isemura","given":"Mamoru"}],"citation-key":"ohishi_2021","container-title":"Molecules","DOI":"10.3390/molecules26020453","ISSN":"1420-3049","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",1]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"2","page":"453","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"The Beneficial Effects of Principal Polyphenols from Green Tea, Coffee, Wine, and Curry on Obesity","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/2/453","volume":"26"},{"id":"oiv_stats_2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"oiv","given":""}],"citation-key":"oiv_stats_2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"title":"World Statistics | OIV","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.oiv.int/what-we-do/global-report?oiv"},{"id":"oiv_stats_wineprod_2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"OIV","given":""}],"citation-key":"oiv_stats_wineprod_2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"title":"Database | OIV","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.oiv.int/what-we-do/data-discovery-report?oiv"},{"id":"oiv-Enoivstrategicplan20202024Pdf-2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,20]]},"author":[{"family":"OIV","given":""}],"citation-key":"oiv-Enoivstrategicplan20202024Pdf-2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11,15]]},"publisher":"OIV","title":"en-oiv-strategic-plan-2020-2024.pdf","type":"document","URL":"https://www.oiv.int/public/medias/8473/en-oiv-strategic-plan-2020-2024.pdf"},{"id":"oleary-EssentialGuideDoing-2017","author":[{"family":"O'Leary","given":"Zina"}],"citation-key":"oleary-EssentialGuideDoing-2017","edition":"3rd","event-place":"London","ISBN":"978-1- 4739-5208-9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"751","publisher":"SAGE Publishing","publisher-place":"London","source":"Zotero","title":"The Essential Guide to Doing Your Research Project","type":"book"},{"id":"oliveira_Oxidationmechanismsoccurring_2011","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Oliveira","given":"Carla Maria"},{"family":"Ferreira","given":"António César Silva"},{"family":"De Freitas","given":"Victor"},{"family":"Silva","given":"Artur M.S."}],"citation-key":"oliveira_Oxidationmechanismsoccurring_2011","container-title":"Food Research International","container-title-short":"Food Research International","DOI":"10.1016/j.foodres.2011.03.050","ISSN":"09639969","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",6]]},"language":"en","license":"https://www.elsevier.com/tdm/userlicense/1.0/","page":"1115-1126","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Oxidation mechanisms occurring in wines","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0963996911002092","volume":"44"},{"id":"oliveri_05applicationchemometrics_2020","author":[{"family":"Oliveri","given":"Paolo"},{"family":"Malegori","given":"Cristina"},{"family":"Mustorgi","given":"Eleonora"},{"family":"Casale","given":"Monica"}],"citation-key":"oliveri_05applicationchemometrics_2020","container-title":"Comprehensive chemometrics: chemical and biochemical data analysis","edition":"Second edition","editor":[{"family":"Brown","given":"Steven"},{"family":"Tauler","given":"Romà"},{"family":"Walczak","given":"Beata"}],"event-place":"Amsterdam Oxford Cambridge, MA","ISBN":"978-0-444-64165-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"eng","publisher":"Elsevier","publisher-place":"Amsterdam Oxford Cambridge, MA","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"4.05 Application of Chemometrics in the Food Sciences","type":"chapter"},{"id":"olson_2018","abstract":"As the bioinformatics field grows, it must keep pace not only with new data but with new algorithms.

Precise retention time prediction facilitates the annotation process and is well known for proteomics. However, the lack of available experimental information for a long time has limited the prediction accuracy for small molecules. Recently introduced large databases for small-molecule retention times make possible reliable machine learning–based predictions for the whole diversity of compounds. Applying simple projections may expand these predictions on various LC systems and conditions. In our work, we describe a complex approach to predict retention times for nano-HPLC that includes the consequent deployment of binary and regression gradient boosting models trained on the METLIN small-molecule dataset and simple projection of the results with a small number of easily available compounds onto nano-HPLC separations. The proposed model outperforms previous attempts to use machine learning for predictions with a 46-s mean absolute error. The overall performance after transfer to nano-LC conditions is less than 155 s (10.8%) in terms of the median absolute (relative) error. To illustrate the applicability of the described approach, we successfully managed to eliminate averagely 25 to 42% of false-positives with a filter threshold derived from ROC curves. Thus, the proposed approach should be used in addition to other well-established in silico methods and their integration may broaden the range of correctly identified molecules.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Osipenko","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Bashkirova","given":"Inga"},{"family":"Sosnin","given":"Sergey"},{"family":"Kovaleva","given":"Oxana"},{"family":"Fedorov","given":"Maxim"},{"family":"Nikolaev","given":"Eugene"},{"family":"Kostyukevich","given":"Yury"}],"citation-key":"osipenko2020","container-title":"Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal Bioanal Chem","DOI":"10.1007/s00216-020-02905-0","ISSN":"1618-2642, 1618-2650","issue":"28","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",11]]},"language":"en","page":"7767-7776","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Machine learning to predict retention time of small molecules in nano-HPLC","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00216-020-02905-0","volume":"412"},{"id":"osiri2011","archive_location":"WOS:000300911700009","author":[{"family":"Osiri","given":"JK"},{"family":"Shadpour","given":"H"},{"family":"Witek","given":"MA"},{"family":"Soper","given":"SA"}],"citation-key":"osiri2011","container-title":"MICROFLUIDICS: TECHNOLOGIES AND APPLICATIONS","DOI":"10.1007/128_2011_152","editor":[{"family":"Lin","given":"BC"}],"ISBN":"0340-1022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011"]]},"page":"261-294","title":"Integrated Multifunctional Microfluidics for Automated Proteome Analyses","type":"chapter","volume":"304"},{"id":"other","abstract":"This is an example document for the achemso document class, intended for submissions to the American Chemical Society for publication.

Until recently, fingerprinting approaches using liquid chromatography applications have been regarded as an effective tool for the assessment of wines employing polyphenol profiles. These profiles are of considerable importance for grapes and wines as they influence greatly the color, sensory, and nutritional quality of the final product. The authenticity and typicity characters are fundamental characteristics, which may be evaluated by the use of polyphenol fingerprinting techniques. Under these conditions, the evolution of polyphenols during the red wine elaboration and maturation processes shows a high importance at the level of the obtained fingerprints. Moreover, the environment factors (vintage, the area of origin, and variety) and the technological conditions significantly influence wine authenticity through the use of polyphenol profiles. Taking into account the complexity of the matter at hand, this review outlines the latest trends in the polyphenol fingerprinting of red wines in association with the transformations that occur during winemaking and storage.","author":[{"family":"Palade","given":"Laurentiu Mihai"},{"family":"Popa","given":"Mona Elena"}],"citation-key":"palade_polyphenolfingerprintingapproaches_2018","container-title":"BEVERAGES","DOI":"10.3390/beverages4040075","event-place":"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","ISSN":"2306-5710","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12]]},"language":"English","number":"75","publisher":"MDPI","publisher-place":"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND","title":"Polyphenol fingerprinting approaches in wine traceability and authenticity: Assessment and implications of red wines","type":"Review","volume":"4"},{"id":"pandas_2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,23]]},"author":[{"family":"pandas","given":""}],"citation-key":"pandas_2022","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",11,14]]},"title":"pandas.DataFrame.resample — pandas 2.0.3 documentation","type":"webpage","URL":"https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.resample.html?highlight=resample#pandas.DataFrame.resample"},{"id":"pap2021","abstract":"In early 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic compelled the field of education to swiftly redesign courses for hybrid and online teaching environments. The lack of in-person learning prompted professionals to rapidly incorporate unique and previously never-seen teaching practices in numerous different fields. One of the biggest challenges that educators have been facing during these difficult times is the lack of hands-on technology-based teaching activites under hybrid and online environments. To mitigate this issue, a small, affordable, and 3D-printed visible spectrophotometer (SpectroBox) was developed to allow instructors to rapidly create a portable instrument and provide a hands-on learning experience for students. SpectroBox is mainly a do-it-yourself at-home platform specifically designed for rapid implementation; thus, instructors can deploy SpectroBox under various learning environments, such as remote and hybrid practices. Included parts are in a small package and are transportable via standard parcel delivery; consequently, students can get access to these spectrometric units rapidly and easily. In this work, detailed design, schematics, and step-by-step instructions are presented for instructors to easily incorporate this system. The SpectroBox project was implemented and tested during the Fall 2020 semester, and student assessment data indicated that the theoretical and practical aspects of visible spectroscopy were better understood by 67% of students with this hands-on learning exercise. The final learning outcome of this project was a broad skillset possessed by students, including 3D printable object design, spectrometer assembly, principles of optical spectroscopy, exploration of design components, basic electronics, data acquisition and processing.

In no sulﬁte-added wine, oxidation chemistry undoubtedly results changed. Therefore, in this work, the phenolic proﬁle of a white wine without adding sulﬁtes, after twelve-month storage, was investigated by HPLC-DAD-MS/MS and compared to a control stored with sulfur dioxide. A total of twenty-six phenolics were detected including hydroxycinnamate derivatives and minor compounds resulting from oxidation processes, i.e. oxidized caffeic acid dimers, whose structures were tentatively proposed on the basis of their UV, MS, and MS/MS typical fragmentation.

RESULTS Tinto Fragoso wine showed higher phenolic content than Moribel, with more anthocyanins, flavonols, and stilbenes. These wines also contained anthocyanin diglucosides not reported for Vitis vinifera wines. The odor activity values of free volatile compounds were calculated to indicate their influence on wine aroma, the fruity aromas of Moribel standing out particularly. The wines studied were positively evaluated by the tasters. Moribel's sensory profile was characterized by red fruit aromas and Tinto Fragoso showed more aromatic intensity and persistence in the mouth. CONCLUSION The results obtained from the first characterization of red wines made from novel Vitis vinifera grapes suggest that Moribel and Tinto Fragoso could be appropriate raw materials for the elaboration of quality young red wines. Tinto Fragoso provided wines with sensorial properties different from those of Tempranillo, and could be an alternative to the well known red wines on the market. © 2018 Society of Chemical Industry","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Pérez-Navarro","given":"José"},{"family":"Izquierdo-Cañas","given":"Pedro M."},{"family":"Mena-Morales","given":"Adela"},{"family":"Martínez-Gascueña","given":"Jesús"},{"family":"Chacón-Vozmediano","given":"Juan L."},{"family":"García-Romero","given":"Esteban"},{"family":"Gómez-Alonso","given":"Sergio"},{"family":"Hermosín-Gutiérrez","given":"Isidro"}],"citation-key":"perez-navarro2019","container-title":"Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture","DOI":"10.1002/jsfa.9403","ISSN":"1097-0010","issue":"5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"language":"en","page":"2108-2123","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"First chemical and sensory characterization of Moribel and Tinto Fragoso wines using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS, GC-MS, and Napping® techniques: comparison with Tempranillo","title-short":"First chemical and sensory characterization of Moribel and Tinto Fragoso wines using HPLC-DAD-ESI-MS/MS, GC-MS, and Napping® techniques","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jsfa.9403","volume":"99"},{"id":"perez-trujillo-ChemometricStudyBottled-2003","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Pérez-Trujillo","given":"Juan-Pedro"},{"family":"Barbaste","given":"Mireille"},{"family":"Medina","given":"Bernard"}],"citation-key":"perez-trujillo-ChemometricStudyBottled-2003","container-title":"Analytical Letters","container-title-short":"Analytical Letters","DOI":"10.1081/AL-120018257","ISSN":"0003-2719, 1532-236X","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2003",1,4]]},"language":"en","page":"679-697","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chemometric Study of Bottled Wines with Denomination of Origin from the Canary Islands (Spain) Based on Ultra-Trace Elemental Content Determined by ICP-MS","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1081/AL-120018257","volume":"36"},{"id":"perri2020","abstract":"Students used an Excel spreadsheet and a Jupyter notebook located at https://chemcompute.org/jupyterhub/ to generate data in lieu of face-to-face laboratory instruction during COVID-19.

Second, students simulated running an HPLC using a Jupyter notebook and designed a method to separate three components of Excedrin. Students reported that the simulation helped them to understand HPLC and suggested that the online activity be used as a supplement when face-to-face laboratory instruction resumes. The main weakness of the online activities was that students did not perform any sample preparation. Therefore, they did not experience the extractions and dilutions required to prepare the analytical sample and had a difficult time working backward to calculate starting amounts from simulated sample concentrations.

The algorithm is termed comprehensive because it functions to correct the entire chromatogram in both dimensions and it preserves the separation information in both dimensions. Although the algorithm is demonstrated by correcting comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC × GC) data, the algorithm is designed to correct shifting in all forms of 2D separations, such as LC × LC, LC × CE, CE × CE, and LC × GC. This 2D alignment algorithm was applied to three different data sets composed of replicate GC × GC separations of (1) three 22-component control mixtures, (2) three gasoline samples, and (3) three diesel samples. The three data sets were collected using slightly different temperature or pressure programs to engender significant retention time shifting in the raw data and then demonstrate subsequent corrections of that shifting upon comprehensive 2D alignment of the data sets. Thirty 12-min GC × GC separations from three 22-component control mixtures were used to evaluate the 2D alignment performance (10 runs/mixture). The average standard deviation of first column retention time improved 5-fold from 0.020 min (before alignment) to 0.004 min (after alignment). Concurrently, the average standard deviation of second column retention time improved 4-fold from 3.5 ms (before alignment) to 0.8 ms (after alignment). Alignment of the 30 control mixture chromatograms took 20 min. The quantitative integrity of the GC × GC data following 2D alignment was also investigated. The mean integrated signal was determined for all components in the three 22-component mixtures for all 30 replicates. The average percent difference in the integrated signal for each component before and after alignment was 2.6%. Singular value decomposition (SVD) was applied to the 22-component control mixture data before and after alignment to show the restoration of trilinearity to the data, since trilinearity benefits chemometric analysis. By applying comprehensive 2D retention time alignment to all three data sets (control mixtures, gasoline samples, and diesel samples), classification by principal component analysis (PCA) substantially improved, resulting in 100% accurate scores clustering.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Pierce","given":"Karisa M."},{"family":"Wood","given":"Lianna F."},{"family":"Wright","given":"Bob W."},{"family":"Synovec","given":"Robert E."}],"citation-key":"pierce_2005","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

Two-dimensional liquid chromatography complements the highly popular hyphenated systems that combine liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry. Two-dimensional liquid chromatography is also applied to the analysis of samples that are not compatible with mass spectrometry (e.g. high-molecular-weight polymers), providing important information on the distribution of the sample components along chemical dimensions (molecular weight, charge, lipophilicity, stereochemistry, etc.). Also, in comparison with conventional one-dimensional liquid chromatography, two-dimensional liquid chromatography provides a greater separation power (peak capacity). Because of the additional selectivity and higher peak capacity, the combination of two-dimensional liquid chromatography with mass spectrometry allows for simpler mixtures of compounds to be introduced in the ion source at any given time, improving quantitative analysis by reducing matrix effects. In this review, we summarize the rationale and principles of two-dimensional liquid chromatography experiments, describe advantages and disadvantages of combining different selectivities and discuss strategies to improve the quality of two-dimensional liquid chromatography separations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Pirok","given":"Bob W.J."},{"family":"Gargano","given":"Andrea F.G."},{"family":"Schoenmakers","given":"Peter J."}],"citation-key":"pirok2018","container-title":"Journal of Separation Science","DOI":"10.1002/jssc.201700863","ISSN":"1615-9314","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","page":"68-98","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Optimizing separations in online comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/jssc.201700863","volume":"41"},{"id":"pirok2019","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Pirok","given":"Bob W.

The characterisation of such complex samples can be arduous and time consuming. Multidimensional analytical techniques have the potential to provide detailed and informative characterisation data, especially if these techniques exploit separation selectivity and detection selectivity. This thesis explores multidimensional approaches for the analysis of complex samples using High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and selective detection. Uni-dimensional HPLC (1DHPLC) multi-detection and multiplexed detection through the use of Active Flow Technology (AFT) columns were used to characterise tobacco leaf extracts to determine key chemical entities by systematically reducing the data complexity of the sample whilst obtaining a greater degree of molecule-specific information. Even though substantial chemical data was obtained, there were limitations; in particular the separation performance of 1DHPLC. This lead to studies directed towards two-dimensional HPLC (2DHPLC), where separation selectivity could be exploited by optimising stationary phase and mobile phase combinations; tailored to the characteristics of the sample.\nIn this work, various combinations of stationary and mobile phases were explored to determine the optimal 2DHPLC selectivity conditions for the separation and analysis of tobacco leaf extracts. However, the performance of 2DHPLC is compromised by the interface between each dimension, namely the compatibility of the solvents and the volume of fluid required in the transfer from the first to the second dimension. This incompatibility often results in loss of separation performance. A preliminary investigation was therefore undertaken to assess the performance of AFT columns in 2DHPLC. The outcomes from this work showed that efficiency and sensitivity could both be improved with the use of AFT columns, however, the results were highly dependent on the construction of the HPLC system.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,2]]},"archive":"Islandora Repository","author":[{"family":"Pravadali-Cekic","given":"Sercan"}],"citation-key":"pravadali-cekic-MultidimensionalApproachesAnalysis-2014","event-place":"Parramatta, New South Wales, Australia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5]]},"language":"en","number-of-pages":"152","publisher":"University of Western Sydney","publisher-place":"Parramatta, New South Wales, Australia","title":"Multidimensional Approaches for the Analysis of Complex Samples Using HPLC","type":"thesis","URL":"http://handle.uws.edu.au:8081/1959.7/uws:29967"},{"id":"pravadali-cekic2015","abstract":"Reaction flow (RE) chromatography with fluorescamine reagent and UV-vis detection was used for the analysis of amino acids.

The protocol described herein outlines the system and CF column set up and the tuning process for an optimized infinite diameter 'virtual' column.","archive_location":"WOS:000380264100010","author":[{"family":"Pravadali-Cekic","given":"S"},{"family":"Kocic","given":"D"},{"family":"Hua","given":"S"},{"family":"Jones","given":"A"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"G"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"pravadali-cekic2016","container-title":"JOVE-JOURNAL OF VISUALIZED EXPERIMENTS","DOI":"10.3791/53471","ISSN":"1940-087X","issue":"112","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6]]},"language":"English","title":"Curtain Flow Column: Optimization of Efficiency and Sensitivity","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"pravadali-cekic2017","abstract":"Reaction flow (RF) chromatography with fluorescamine reagent and fluorescence detection (FLD) was used for the analysis of amino acids.

RF columns achieved greater sensitivity compared to conventional PCD methods, without the need for reaction loops, which resulted in more efficient separations. The RF-PCD method also achieved limits of detection (LOD) from the low picomole to subnanomole range. The calibration data of the RF-PCD technique yielded R-2 = 0.99 and % relative standard deviation in peak areas ranging from 0.34% to 5%. Through reaction flow chromatography, multiplexed detection was also achieved allowing the monitoring and analysis of derivatized and nonderivatized flow streams simultaneously.","archive_location":"WOS:000399500900004","author":[{"family":"Pravadali-Cekic","given":"S"},{"family":"Jones","given":"A"},{"family":"Kazarian","given":"AA"},{"family":"Paull","given":"B"},{"family":"Soliven","given":"A"},{"family":"Ritchie","given":"H"},{"family":"Camenzuli","given":"M"},{"family":"Leung","given":"L"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"GR"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"pravadali-cekic2017","container-title":"JOURNAL OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES","DOI":"10.1080/10826076.2017.1285312","ISSN":"1082-6076","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"English","page":"83-92","title":"Postcolumn derivatization of amino acids using reaction flow chromatography columns with fluorescence detection: A fast new approach to selective derivatization techniques","type":"article-journal","volume":"40"},{"id":"pravadali2013","abstract":"Herein we assess the separation space offered by a liquid chromatography system with an optimised uni-dimensional separation for the determination of the key chemical entities in the highly complex matrix of a tobacco leaf extract. Multiple modes of detection, including UV-visible absorbance, chemiluminescence (acidic potassium permanganate, manganese(IV), and tris(2,2'-bipyridine)ruthenium(III)), mass spectrometry and DPPH radical scavenging were used in an attempt to systematically reduce the data complexity of the sample whilst obtaining a greater degree of molecule-specific information. A large amount of chemical data was obtained, but several limitations in the ability to assign detector responses to particular compounds, even with the aid of complementary detection systems, were observed. Thirty-three compounds were detected via MS on the tobacco extract and 12 out of 32 compounds gave a peak height ratio (PHR) greater than 0.33 on one or more detectors. This paper serves as a case study of these limitations, illustrating why multidimensional chromatography is an important consideration when developing a comprehensive chemical detection system.

While acetonitrile would provide both necessary sample solubility and sample stability for chromatographic analysis, significant peak fronting was observed when it was used as the diluent with a concomitant loss in resolution. Similar fronting was not observed when preparing sample solutions in ethanol, 2-propanol, methanol, or a 1:1 mixture of methanol and ethanol. The source of this fronting was explored by performing two sample loading studies: constant sample loading with varying volume and constant volume with varying loading. Peak asymmetry was used as a quantitative measure of the resulting peak fronting. These analyses indicate that the fronting observed when using acetonitrile as a diluent could arise due to a strong-solvent like effect of this solvent and or the solubility of the solute in the microenvironment with this combination of column packing and eluent.","author":[{"family":"Price","given":"Kathi"},{"family":"Clausen","given":"Andrew M."},{"family":"Helmy","given":"Roy"}],"citation-key":"price","container-title":"Journal of liquid chromatography & related technologies","DOI":"10.1080/10826070802281612","event-place":"Colchester","ISSN":"1082-6076","issue":"15","language":"eng","page":"2286–2295","publisher":"Taylor & Francis Group","publisher-place":"Colchester","source":"west-sydney-primo.com","title":"Effect of Injection Diluent on a Chiral Separation on an Amylose S-α-Methylbenzylcarbamate Chiral Stationary Phase (Short Communication)","type":"article-journal","volume":"31"},{"id":"priniski2018","abstract":"Personal relevance goes by many names in the motivation literature,\nstemming from a number of theoretical frameworks.

The two approaches were applied to commercial Cabernet Sauvignon wines from vintage 2015 originating from three wine regions of Australia, along with Bordeaux, France. Extreme gradient boosting discriminant analysis (XGBDA) was examined among other multivariate algorithms for classification of wines.

With the ever-increasing advancements in analytical platforms, research into spectroscopic methods is thriving as they offer a powerful tool for rapid wine authentication. In particular, spectroscopic techniques have been identified as a user-friendly and economical alternative to traditional analyses involving more complex instrumentation that may not readily be deployable in an industry setting. Chemometrics plays an indispensable role in the interpretation and modelling of spectral data and is frequently used in conjunction with spectroscopy for sample classification.

This is especially important for modern analytical columns packed with small particles, where wall effects dominate the band broadening. Detailed knowledge about the packing microstructure of packed analytical columns has so far not been acquired. Here, we present the first three-dimensional reconstruction protocol for these columns utilizing focused ion-beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) on a commercial 2.1 mm inner diameter x 50 mm length narrow-bore analytical column packed with 1.7 mu m bridged-ethyl hybrid silica particles. Two sections from the packed bed are chosen for reconstruction by FIB-SEM: one from the bulk packing region of the column and one from its critical wall region. This allows quantification of structural differences between the wall region and the center of the bed due to effects induced by the hard, confining column wall. Consequences of these effects on local flow velocity in the column are analyzed with flow simulations utilizing the lattice-Boltzmann method. The reconstructions of the bed structures reveal significant structural differences in the wall region (extending radially over approximately 62 particle diameters) compared to the center of the column. It includes the local reduction of the external porosity by up to 10% and an increase of the mean particle diameter by up to 3%, resulting in a decrease of the local flow velocity by up to 23%. In addition, four (more ordered) layers of particles in the direct vicinity of the column wall induce local velocity fluctuations by up to a factor of three regarding the involved velocity amplitudes. These observations highlight the impact of radial variations in packing microstructure on band migration and column performance. This knowledge on morphological peculiarities of column wall effects helps guiding us towards further optimization of the packing process for analytical HPLC columns. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

With the earlier introduction of the PARAFAC2 (PARAllel FACtor analysis 2) based PARADISe (PARAFAC2 based Deconvolution and Identification System) approach in 2017, this task was made considerably more time-efficient. However, there are still a number of manual steps in the analysis which require data analytical expertise. One of these is the need to define whether or not each PARAFAC2 resolved component represents a peak suitable for integration. As the peaks may change in both shape and location on the elution time-axis, this presents a problem which cannot be readily solved by applying a linear classifier, such as PLS-DA (Partial Least Squares regression for Discriminant Analysis). As part of our ongoing efforts to further automate analysis of Gas Chromatography with Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS), we therefore explore a convolutional neural network classifier, capable of handling these shifts and variations in shape. The theory of convolutional neural networks and application on vector samples is briefly explained, and the performance is tested against a PLS-DA classifier, a shallow artificial neural network and a locally weighted regression model. The models are built on a training set with PARAFAC2 resolved components from eight different aroma related GC-MS runs with a total of over 70,000 elution profile samples, and validated using another, independent, GC-MS dataset. Based on Receiver Operating Characteristic curves (ROC) and manual analysis of the misclassified cases, it is shown that the convolutional network consistently outperforms the competing models, yielding an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.95 for peak classification. Examples are given illustrating that this new approach provides convincing means to automatically assess and evaluate modelled elution profiles of chromatographic data and thereby remove this laborious manual step.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,31]]},"author":[{"family":"Risum","given":"Anne Bech"},{"family":"Bro","given":"Rasmus"}],"citation-key":"risum_usingdeeplearning_2019","container-title":"Talanta","container-title-short":"Talanta","DOI":"10.1016/j.talanta.2019.05.053","ISSN":"0039-9140","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",11,1]]},"language":"en","page":"255-260","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Using deep learning to evaluate peaks in chromatographic data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914019305375","volume":"204"},{"id":"roberts_TargetedMetabolomics_2012","abstract":"The metabolome is the terminal downstream product of the genome and consists of the total complement of all the low molecular weight molecules (metabolites) in a cell, tissue or organism.

Microsoft Excel tutorials that were previously introduced have either been not specific to chemistry, require multiple assignments throughout the semester to acquire the necessary skills, or are designed for deprecated versions of the software. In this work, we present an argument for implementing a chemistry-specific, version-agnostic spreadsheet interactive laboratory exercise that uses basic, general chemistry concepts to have students explore and learn the computer skills that are necessary to succeed in a quantitative analysis course.

This article presents and discusses a comparative study of aroma profile and phenolic content of the Montepulciano wine from the Marches and the Abruzzo regions. The volatile composition of wines was determined by using headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) coupled with gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The PDMS fibre was chosen. The dominating esters in Montepulciano wines were ethyl hexanoate, ethyl decanoate, and ethyl octanoate, whereas phenyl ethanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol were dominating alcohols. Phenolic compounds, namely gallic acid, p-coumaric acid, trans-ferulic acid, caffeic acid, trans-resveratrol, (+)-catechin and (−)-epicatechin, were examined using HPLC–MS with direct injection of wine samples. The total phenolic content of the analysed wines was in the range of 30.4–61.9mgl−1. The presence of high amounts of esters seems to characterise the volatiles of Montepulciano wines from the Marches, whereas a high level of alcohols was found in Montepulciano wines from Abruzzo. Moreover, multivariate chemometric techniques, such as cluster analysis and principal component analysis, supported this thesis. Headspace solid phase microextraction and gas chromatography–mass spectrometry were used to analyse 20 commercial wine samples (Montepulciano monovarietal red wines) from the Marches (10 samples) and Abruzzo (10 samples).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Sagratini","given":"Gianni"},{"family":"Maggi","given":"Filippo"},{"family":"Caprioli","given":"Giovanni"},{"family":"Cristalli","given":"Gloria"},{"family":"Ricciutelli","given":"Massimo"},{"family":"Torregiani","given":"Elisabetta"},{"family":"Vittori","given":"Sauro"}],"citation-key":"sagratini_Comparativestudyaroma_2012","container-title":"Food Chemistry","container-title-short":"Food Chemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2011.11.108","ISSN":"0308-8146","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012",6,1]]},"language":"en","page":"1592-1599","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Comparative study of aroma profile and phenolic content of Montepulciano monovarietal red wines from the Marches and Abruzzo regions of Italy using HS-SPME–GC–MS and HPLC–MS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030881461101692X","volume":"132"},{"id":"saito_HistorySupercriticalFluid_2013","abstract":"In the early days of supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), it was categorized as high-pressure or dense gas chromatography (HPGC or DGC) and low boiling point hydrocarbons were used as supercritical mobile phase.

The perturbation peak method was used to measure the adsorption isotherm of phenol on the original and regenerated monolith and the adsorption energy distributions were calculated for identifying any change in the degree of heterogeneity. Although peak shapes improved considerably after regeneration, no significant differences were found in the detailed characterization of the processed adsorption data between the original column and the regenerated one.

This study is based on several observations by us and others that chromatographic runs often, for technical reasons, include more or less portions of air in the injections. It is therefore extremely important to find out the impact of air on the column performance, the reliability of the results derived from analyses where air was injected, and the effect on the column homogeneity. We used a photographic approach for visualising the air transport phenomena, and found that the air transport through the column is comprised of many different types of transport phenomena, such as laminal flow, viscous fingering like flows, channels and bulbs, and pulsations. More particularly, the air clouds within the column definitely interact in the adsorption, i.e. mobile phase adsorbed to the column surface is displaced. In addition, irrespective of the type of air transport phenomena, the air does not penetrate the column homogeneously. This process is strongly flow dependent. In this work we study air transport both in an analytical scale and a semi-prep column.

With this study we aim at first hand to investigate if viscous fingering or any similar and related effects to these in preparative levels also take place in analytical scale HPLC and if so, what impact this have on the separation performance. We could show that not only viscous finger does occur in analytical scale columns but also that peak distortions are apparent already at viscosity ratios between eluent and sample solution approaching unity. The latter indicates that a pre-viscous phenomenon is occurring that could be more important than the viscous fingering itself at the analytical format. As the viscosity contrast increases, the leading edge of the sample band distorts and the band volume increases, both leading to a decrease in performance.

Indeed, red wine contains relevant amounts of polyphenols, for which evidence of their biological activity and positive health effects are abundant; however, it is also well-known that alcohol, even at a low level of intake, may have severe consequences for health. Among others, it is directly related to a number of non-communicable diseases, like liver cirrhosis or diverse types of cancer. The IARC classifies alcohol as a Group 1 carcinogen, causally associated with the development of cancers of the upper digestive tract and liver, and, with sufficient evidence, can be positively associated with colorectum and female breast cancer. In these circumstances, it is tricky, if not irresponsible, to spread any message on the benefits of moderate wine drinking, about which no actual consensus exists.

Finally, characteristic compounds of each appellation were tentatively identiﬁed by means of liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) analysis.

Sooner or later, a flow instability termed viscous fingering (VF) develops. This phenomenon is important in chromatography because the solute plug does not have the same viscosity as the mobile phase. Because the sample is often much more viscous than the mobile phase, it is the interface at the rear of the sample band that is usually unstable. This situation is frequent in many modes of chromatography, e.g., in preparative and in multidimensional chromatography, in size exclusion chromatography, in frontal analysis. and in other physicochemical measurements (e.g., determination of adsorption isotherms and of mass transfer parameters). When the solute plug is more viscous than the mobile phase, we observed that the solute band compressed. When the viscosity contrast increased up to 0.30 cP, fingers appeared to trail behind the solute plug. The development of fingers then became more substantial as the viscosity contrast increased. To avoid effects associated with VF, the mobile phase and the solute plug should have nearly the same viscosity. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

Two conditions were tested: (1) the mobile phase viscosity was less than the injection plug viscosity, and (2) the mobile phase viscosity was greater than the injection plug viscosity. Under the first condition, retention time and elution performance decreased as the viscosity contrast between the mobile phase and injection plug increased. The effect on performance was more marked as the injection volume increased. A decrease in performance of 12% for compounds with retention factors up to 2.8 was apparent even when the viscosity contrast was only 0.165\ncP. In the second set of conditions, elution performance was actually observed to increase, by as much as 25% for a 40\nμL injection, as the viscosity contrast between the mobile phase and the solute plug increased. No change in the retention factor was observed. This behaviour was attributed to the shape of an injection plug as it enters into the column, whereby a low viscosity plug permeates away from the wall when the column contains a higher viscosity mobile phase, and vice a versa for a high viscosity plug entering a low viscosity mobile phase. At no stage was either a band splitting or shoulders observed with viscosity contrasts up to 1.283\ncP, as could have been expected.","author":[{"family":"Shalliker","given":"R.

The operation of a comprehensive method of analysis was compared to a heart‐cutting approach. The comprehensive approach employed a high resolution diastereomer separation in the first dimension and a low peak capacity C18, high speed separation according to molecular weight. Because of solvent incompatibility between the dimensions in the comprehensive method, successful separation of the diastereomers of the oligomers was not possible. The heart‐cutting approach used a C18 monolith in the first dimension, which was selective only for molecular weight. Entire molecular weight fractions were then transported to the second dimension in an online heart‐cutting process for the separation of diastereomers. The heart‐cutting process was more successful in that 228 components of the 511 within the sample were recognized. This series of separations was undertaken in less than 6 h.","author":[{"family":"Shalliker","given":"Ross Andrew"}],"citation-key":"shalliker2009a","container-title":"Journal of Separation Science","DOI":"10.1002/jssc.200900175","event-place":"Weinheim","ISSN":"0935-6304","issue":"12, 17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",8,27]]},"language":"eng","page":"2903–2911","publisher":"WILEY-VCH Verlag","publisher-place":"Weinheim","source":"west-sydney-primo.com","title":"Two-dimensional HPLC analysis of oligostyrenes: Comprehensive and online heart-cutting techniques","title-short":"Two-dimensional HPLC analysis of oligostyrenes","type":"article-journal","volume":"23, 32"},{"id":"shalliker2010","abstract":"Understanding the nature of viscosity contrast induced flow instabilities is an important aspect in the design of two-dimensional HPLC separations. When the viscosity contrast between the sample plug and the mobile phase is sufficiently large, the phenomenon known as viscous fingering can be induced. Viscous fingering is a flow instability phenomenon that occurs at the interface between two fluids with different viscosities. In liquid chromatography, viscous fingering results in the solute band undergoing a change in form as it enters into the chromatography column. Moreover, even in the absence of viscous fingering, band shapes change shape at low viscosity contrasts. These changes can result in a noticeable change in separation performance, with the result depending on whether the solvent pushing the solute plug has a higher or lower viscosity than the solute plug. These viscosity induced changes become more important as the solute injection volume increases and hence understanding the process becomes critical in the implementation of multidimensional HPLC techniques, since in these techniques the sample injection plug into the second dimension is an order of magnitude greater than in one-dimensional HPLC. This review article assesses the current understanding of the viscosity contrast induced processes as they relate to liquid chromatographic separation behaviour.","archive_location":"WOS:000273921800003","author":[{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"},{"family":"Guiochon","given":"G"}],"citation-key":"shalliker2010","container-title":"ANALYST","DOI":"10.1039/b908633c","ISSN":"0003-2654","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010"]]},"language":"English","page":"222-229","title":"Solvent viscosity mismatch between the solute plug and the mobile phase: Considerations in the applications of two-dimensional HPLC","type":"article-journal","volume":"135"},{"id":"shalliker2012","archive_location":"WOS:000355136000001","author":[{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"shalliker2012","container-title":"HYPHENATED AND ALTERNATIVE METHODS OF DETECTION IN CHROMATOGRAPHY","editor":[{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"ISBN":"0069-3936","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"English","page":"XI-XII","title":"Hyphenated and Alternative Methods of Detection in Chromatography Preface","type":"chapter","volume":"104"},{"id":"shalliker2014","abstract":"The variation in mobile phase velocity as a function of the column radius has been shown to be a major limitation in the efficiency of HPLC columns. One contributing factor to the variability in the flow velocity stems from the heterogeneity in the radial packing density, leading to what has been described as the 'wall-effect'. The wall-effect generates parabolic-type elution profiles, which dilutes the sample and creates tailing bands. In this communication a new column technology is discussed that has been designed to overcome the wall effect, minimising the limitations associated with packing heterogeneity. This technology has been referred to as active flow technology and consists of two types of column designs, parallel segmented flow and curtain flow. In both these column designs sample that elutes through the column in the radial central region of the bed is separated from the flow that elutes along the wall region. Hence, the sample that elutes through the most efficiently packed region of the bed is collected to the detector. As a consequence more theoretical plates are obtained, and sensitivity is increased since the sample is not diluted by the diffuse tail. Sensitivity is enhanced further in the curtain flow design. The benefits of these new columns are discussed (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

Specifically, the umami taste has been investigated in terms of whether it enhances or reduces the other taste modalities. These studies, however, are based on individual perception and not on a molecular level. In this study we investigated umami-sweet taste interactions using umami compounds including monosodium glutamate (MSG), 5’-mononucleotides and glutamyl-dipeptides, glutamate-glutamate (Glu-Glu) and glutamate-aspartic acid (Glu-Asp), in human sweet taste receptor hT1R2/hT1R3-expressing cells. The sensitivity of sucrose to hT1R2/hT1R3 was significantly attenuated by MSG and umami active peptides but not by umami active nucleotides. Inhibition of sweet receptor activation by MSG and glutamyl peptides is obvious when sweet receptors are activated by sweeteners that target the extracellular domain (ECD) of T1R2, such as sucrose and acesulfame K, but not by cyclamate, which interact with the T1R3 transmembrane domain (TMD). Application of umami compounds with lactisole, inhibitory drugs that target T1R3, exerted a more severe inhibitory effect. The inhibition was also observed with F778A sweet receptor mutant, which have the defect in function of T1R3 TMD. These results suggest that umami peptides affect sweet taste receptors and this interaction prevents sweet receptor agonists from binding to the T1R2 ECD in an allosteric manner, not to the T1R3. This is the first report to define the interaction between umami and sweet taste receptors.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,14]]},"author":[{"family":"Shim","given":"Jaewon"},{"family":"Son","given":"Hee Jin"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Yiseul"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Ki Hwa"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Jung Tae"},{"family":"Moon","given":"Hana"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Min Jung"},{"family":"Misaka","given":"Takumi"},{"family":"Rhyu","given":"Mee-Ra"}],"citation-key":"shim_ModulationSweetTaste_2015","container-title":"PLoS ONE","container-title-short":"PLoS One","DOI":"10.1371/journal.pone.0124030","ISSN":"1932-6203","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",4,8]]},"page":"e0124030","PMCID":"PMC4390298","PMID":"25853419","source":"PubMed Central","title":"Modulation of Sweet Taste by Umami Compounds via Sweet Taste Receptor Subunit hT1R2","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4390298/","volume":"10"},{"id":"sholl2021","abstract":"Long-term success in scientific research requires skills that go well beyond technical prowess.

This is a necessity when analyzing highly complex samples; however, the size of high resolution LC-HRMS datasets can cause difficulties when applying advanced data analysis techniques. In this work, LC-HRMS analyses of known amphetamine samples and unknown bacterial lipid samples were carried out and multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) was applied to the data to obtain mathematical separation of overlapped analyte signals. In order to minimize computational strain, a novel strategy was developed which minimizes the number of irrelevant masses analyzed at full resolution. To do this, data were first binned to unit mass resolution and MCR-ALS was performed. This provided mathematical components for each analyte present plus background components. In the resolved spectral profiles of analyte components, masses above a preset intensity threshold were extracted, discarding all other masses, and expanded to successively higher levels of resolution, applying MCR-ALS at each level. These steps were repeated until 0.001 amu resolution was achieved, as dictated by the resolution of the instrument; in this case, a time-of-flight mass spectrometer. This strategy allowed for the accurate recovery of all known amphetamine compounds and select bacterial lipid extracts while minimizing the size of the data, therefore minimizing computational analysis time and data storage requirements. This relatively simple strategy enables the effective coupling of LC-HRMS with MCR-ALS.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Sinanian","given":"Melanie M."},{"family":"Cook","given":"Daniel W."},{"family":"Rutan","given":"Sarah C."},{"family":"Wijesinghe","given":"Dayanjan S."}],"citation-key":"sinanian_multivariatecurveresolutionalternating_2016","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

In this article we setup the possibility of using new approach using new EIM – Module – IRMS (Ethanol Isotope Measurement – Module – Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry) instrumental technique and new analytical parameter δD<sub>n<sub/>(δ<sup>2<sup/>H<sub>n<sub/>) wine ethanol value, which represents δ<sup>2<sup/>H value of non-exchangeable hydrogen stable isotope ratio in ethanol, with other isotopic species (δ<sup>18<sup/>O values in wine water) to improve detection of illegal wine production practices such as addition of sugar and/or dilution with water. Total of 42 wine samples were analyzed. 10 wine samples (out of 42) were prepared from grapes by alcoholic fermentation and analyzed for δD<sub>n<sub/> values of ethanol. 19 wine samples (out of 42) were collected from wine producers in Serbia plus 1 wine samples designated from United States was taken from Serbian market and analyzed for δD<sub>n<sub/> values of ethanol, δ<sup>18<sup/>O values in wine water and also δ<sup>13<sup/>C values in wine ethanol. Furthermore 9 wine samples (out of 42) were taken from Hungarian market and analyzed for δD<sub>n<sub/> values of ethanol, and also 3 wine samples (out of 42) were taken from Austrian market and analyzed for δD<sub>n<sub/> values of ethanol. All experiments were done in 4 isotope laboratories located in US, Austria, Hungary and People's Republic of China. δD<sub>n<sub/> values of ethanol were measured by using EIM Module connected to FlashHT 2000 pyrolizer (one laboratory – Imprint Analytics GmbH, Austria), while in other 3 laboratories (US – COIL – Cornell University, Stable Isotope Laboratory, Hungary – Isotoptech Ltd, Debrecen, Hungary and China – C.N.R.I.F.F.I. – China National Institute of Food and Fermentation Industries Limited) EIM Module was connected to TC/EA (High Temperature Conversion Elemental Analyzer). Peripherals in all laboratories were further interfaced with isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Furthermore δ<sup>18<sup/>O values in wine water were measured by using Gas Bench II interfaced also with isotope ratio mass spectrometer (one laboratory – US). Obtained results from all 4 laboratories have shown that this new approach which uses δD<sub>n<sub/> in wine ethanol is more effective in improving detection of illegal wine production practices (sugar enrichment and water dilution) and origin of ethanol, and also detecting the addition of corn or beet sugar, sugar syrup to wine, or dilution of grape must with water prior to alcoholic fermentation.<b>Keywords:<b/> Wine authenticity; EIM – Module – IRMS; Stable Isotope; Isotope Ratio Mass Spectrometry; Wine; Watering; Chaptalization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Smajlovic","given":"I."},{"family":"Wang","given":"D."},{"family":"Túri","given":"M."},{"family":"Qiding","given":"Z."},{"family":"Futó","given":"I."},{"family":"Veres","given":"M."},{"family":"Sparks","given":"K.

Before statistical comparison, registration must be established to match corresponding analytes from run to run. Alignment, the most popular correspondence approach, consists of constructing a function that warps the content of runs to most closely match a given reference sample. To date, dozens of correspondence algorithms have been proposed, creating a daunting challenge for practitioners in algorithm selection. Yet, existing reviews have highlighted only a few approaches. In this review, we describe 50 correspondence algorithms to facilitate practical algorithm selection. We elucidate the motivation for correspondence and analyze the limitations of current approaches, which include prohibitive runtimes, numerous user parameters, model limitations and the need for reference samples. We suggest and describe a paradigm shift for overcoming current correspondence limitations by building on known liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry behavior.","author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Rob"},{"family":"Ventura","given":"Dan"},{"family":"Prince","given":"John T."}],"citation-key":"smith_2015","container-title":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"Brief Bioinform","DOI":"10.1093/bib/bbt080","ISSN":"1477-4054","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015",1]]},"language":"eng","page":"104-117","PMID":"24273217","source":"PubMed","title":"LC-MS alignment in theory and practice: a comprehensive algorithmic review","title-short":"LC-MS alignment in theory and practice","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},{"id":"smith_2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,25]]},"author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Steven W."}],"citation-key":"smith_2024","container-title":"The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"title":"The Scientist and Engineer's Guide to Digital Signal Processing's Table of Content","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.dspguide.com/pdfbook.htm"},{"id":"smith.Chapter13Delta.1997","citation-key":"smith.Chapter13Delta.1997","container-author":[{"family":"Smith","given":"Steven W"},{"literal":"others"}],"container-title":"The scientist and engineer's guide to digital signal processing","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997"]]},"publisher":"California Technical Pub.

Efficiency measurements before and after sylation verified that the integrity of the silica monolith itself was not affected by the modification process, the highest number of theoretical plates (N/m) using anisole was 81,650. A brief selectivity test was then undertaken to assess methylene selectivity and phenyl selectivity. Elemental analysis was used to determine the homogeneity of the carbon load throughout the monolithic bed, and was compared to two commercial C18 and one 'self modified C18 silica monoliths.

The modified C18 monolith proved to be of high quality with an efficiency of 73,267 N m(-1), fast analysis times (operated at flow rates up to 3 mL min(-1) using a conventional 400 bar HPLC system) and improved resolution of a set of polar and non-polar substituted aromatics in comparison to a commercial C18 monolith.","archive_location":"WOS:000335778700003","author":[{"family":"Soliven","given":"A"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"GR"},{"family":"Hilder","given":"EF"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"},{"family":"Stevenson","given":"PG"}],"citation-key":"soliven2014c","container-title":"CHROMATOGRAPHIA","DOI":"10.1007/s10337-014-2667-z","ISSN":"0009-5893","issue":"9-10","issued":{"date-parts":[["2014",5]]},"language":"English","page":"663-671","title":"The Development of the In Situ Modification of 1st Generation Analytical Scale Silica Monoliths","type":"article-journal","volume":"77"},{"id":"soliven2015","abstract":"As of yet the commercial options of analytical scale silica monoliths are still limited to: silica, C8 and C18.

Two commercial first-generation analytical scale bare silica monoliths were subjected to a \"remodification\" process that involved the following: (1) coating of the silica through an in situ silylation procedure to bond ligands of choice to the surface, (2) periodic chromatographic characterization of the coated surface over 2,000 column volumes, and (3) removing the bonded ligands using a 0.1 M hydrochloric (HCI) acid wash, to regenerate the initial silica surface.\nThis remodification protocol was repeated for three cycles to fabricate monoliths with selected functionalities. To test reproducibility, this study was conducted on two different commercial silica monoliths subjected to this treatment involving synthetic reactions with organo-silanes and subsequent stripping with acid washes. Both monoliths were functionalized with three different coatings, without significant degradation of the initial columns' silica infrastructure and excellent stability (tested up to 2,000 column volumes). One of the monoliths had measured theoretical plates per meter (N/m) of 57,000 N/m for the original silica surface, 105,000 N/m for the first cyano coating, and 60,000 N/m for the third phenyl coating. The stationary phases prepared by remodification possessed similar selectivities to those synthesized from new silica monoliths. The results of the Tanaka test shows evidence of residual ligands of previous coatings. However, the methylene and phenyl selectivity proved to display the same characteristics as other modified monoliths of the same functionality, not subjected to the remodified process.

Three problematic pesticides, notorious for poor peak shape and ionization issues were selected to illustrate the advantages and disadvantages of utilizing the PSF column as an alternative front-end separation interface for LC-MS approaches. Assessment of performance for each pesticide was based on a spiked lemon matrix prepared via a QuEChERS (quick, easy, cheap, rugged and safe) sample preparation approach. Comparisons were made between assays conducted using a conventional column and a PSF column (operated with a 40% segmentation ratio), each packed with identical stationary phases and of the same column format. Both columns were connected to the MS detector using the exact same connective tubing and electrospray (ESI) conditions. The primary advantage of the PSF column was that it enabled an increase in throughput by at least 2.5 times compared to the conventional HPLC column. At the same time, the volumetric flow to the MS was exactly the same for both the PSF column and the conventional column. Effectively there was no difference in the sensitivity provided by peak areas between the PSF and conventional columns: peak area LOQ values were comparable, 4-9 mu g/kg for the PSF and 4-8 mu g/kg for the conventional column. This is a vital requirement for food control methods to secure absence at default maximum residue limit (MRL) of 10 mu g/kg (10 ppb) level. Since the efficiency of the PSF was superior to that of the conventional column, the peak width of eluting components was reduced by as mud). as 70% in the former compared to the peak widths on the latter.

This methodology has been tested and validated on various commodities, and two examples are described (melon, peach).

For this reason, we studied the retention behaviour and selectivity of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) on Synergi polar-RP and Cosmosil 5PBB chromatography columns using methanol/water, acetonitrile/water, benzene spiked (0.5%) methanol/water, and benzene spiked (0.5%) acetonitrile/water mobile phases. These four solvent systems were employed because pi-pi interactions between the aromatic solute (i.e., PAH) and the aromatic stationary phase should be inhibited in mobile phases that are also pi electron rich, and hence a competitor for the analyte. Our results showed that the acetonitrile mobile phases were substantially stronger eluents than the methanol mobile phases, which was consistent with the premise that retention of aromatic compounds is sensitive to pi-pi interactions. Aside from changes in absolute retention, selectivity of the PAHs was also generally greater in methanol rather than acetonitrile mobile phases because the methanol did not attenuate the pi-pi bonding interactions between the PAH and the stationary phase; but, despite this, the retention behaviour of the Synergi polar-RP column was similar to that observed on C-18 columns. The excessive retention times of the Cosmosil 5PBB column were decreased dramatically when acetonitrile was used as the mobile phase; however, selectivity between structural isomers was lost.","archive_location":"WOS:000252348000002","author":[{"family":"Stevenson","given":"PG"},{"family":"Kayillo","given":"S"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"GR"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"stevenson2008","container-title":"JOURNAL OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES","DOI":"10.1080/10826070701780607","ISSN":"1082-6076","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2008"]]},"language":"English","page":"324-347","title":"Effects of pi-pi interactions on the separation of PAHs on phenyl-type stationary phases","type":"article-journal","volume":"31"},{"id":"stevenson2010","abstract":"The frontal analysis method was used to measure the adsorption isotherms of phenol, 4-chlorophenol, p-cresol, 4-methoxyphenol and caffeine on a series of columns packed with home-made alkyl-phenyl bonded silica particles.

The saturation capacities depend on whether the spacer of the ligands have an even or an odd number of carbon atoms, with the even alkyl chain lengths having a greater saturation capacity than the odd alkyl chain lengths.

Previous works have found that there are differences in retention characteristics between these chain lengths and this was explored further here. It was found that when analysing the separations by quadrants, using a geometric approach to factor analysis and by measuring the normalised mean radius, subtle differences in the separations were observed and the butyl phenyl phase was more selective for the high to medium polarity species. However, there was very little difference in separation behaviour for the hydrophobic components within the coffee sample. Overall, the analysis of the entire separation showed very little difference.","archive_location":"WOS:000286452700004","author":[{"family":"Stevenson","given":"PG"},{"family":"Mnatsakanyan","given":"M"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"GR"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"stevenson2011","container-title":"JOURNAL OF SEPARATION SCIENCE","DOI":"10.1002/jssc.201000345","ISSN":"1615-9306","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2011",1]]},"language":"English","page":"21-26","title":"Selectivity in separation using pi electron-rich stationary phases for the comprehensive two-dimensional analysis of cafe espresso","type":"article-journal","volume":"34"},{"id":"stevenson2013","abstract":"Two multidimensional high performance liquid chromatography separations of an Australian red wine are presented, greater than 70% of the available separation space was used.

The surviving scroll, a copy of an earlier text from around 3,000 B.C., gives us remarkable insight into the medical practice of ancient Egyptians in the Nile River bed during the dawn of civilization. The Papyrus is divided into 48 cases, most of which describe traumatic injuries. The text instructs the physician to examine the patient and look for revealing physical signs that may indicate the outcome of the injury. Although in modern medicine we take for granted that the use of physical examination and rational thinking lead to an accurate conclusion, 5,000 years ago, this was extraordinary. The Edwin Smith Papyrus cast aside the prevailing magic and mysticism of that time in favor of logic and deductive reasoning. As Egyptian civilization declined during the next millennium, the teachings of the Papyrus would be lost. It would not be until 300 B.C. when Hippocrates and his disciples in ancient Greece would once again revive logic in medical thinking and teaching. It is believed that the ancient Greeks had knowledge of the contents of the Edwin Smith Papyrus and its teachings and used them as the basis for their writings. As Europe entered the Dark Ages, so did medicine yet again, reverting to spells and prayers instead of judgment and reason. Although Hippocrates teachings were recognized by some scholars during the Middle Ages, they did not make up the basis for mainstream medical knowledge. With the dawn of the Renaissance, medicine would finally purge itself of its past supernatural foundation. Hippocratic teachings were used to form the basis of modern medicine, and medical pioneers in the 17th century studied the ancient Greek texts as the origin for their ideas. Many of the concepts physicians and patients today take as common knowledge originated in the Edwin Smith Papyrus. The authors attempt to uncover some of these fundamental ideas and trace them through time until their incorporation in our modern medical knowledge base. It is the rational, logical, and advanced thinking exhibited in the Edwin Smith Papyrus that mandates its respect from modern otolaryngologists and all physicians alike.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Stiefel","given":"Marc"},{"family":"Shaner","given":"Arlene"},{"family":"Schaefer","given":"Steven D."}],"citation-key":"stiefel2006","container-title":"The Laryngoscope","DOI":"10.1097/01.mlg.0000191461.08542.a3","ISSN":"1531-4995","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"language":"en","page":"182-188","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The Edwin Smith Papyrus: The Birth of Analytical Thinking in Medicine and Otolaryngology","title-short":"The Edwin Smith Papyrus","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1097/01.mlg.0000191461.08542.a3","volume":"116"},{"id":"stitzel2013","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Stitzel","given":"Shannon E."},{"family":"Sours","given":"Ryan E."}],"citation-key":"stitzel2013","container-title":"Journal of Chemical Education","DOI":"10.1021/ed3003918","ISSN":"0021-9584","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,1]]},"note":"ADS Bibcode: 2013JChEd..90.1227S","page":"1227-1230","source":"NASA ADS","title":"High-Performance Liquid Chromatography Analysis of Single-Origin Chocolates for Methylxanthine Composition and Provenance Determination","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013JChEd..90.1227S","volume":"90"},{"id":"stoev1999","archive_location":"WOS:000081110300002","author":[{"family":"Stoev","given":"G"}],"citation-key":"stoev1999","container-title":"JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A","DOI":"10.1016/S0021-9673(99)00342-8","ISSN":"0021-9673","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["1999",6,11]]},"page":"3-11","title":"Influence of capillary column efficiency on the reliability of the identification of complex mixtures by gas chromatography","type":"article-journal","volume":"845"},{"id":"stoll2007","archive_location":"WOS:000250619400003","author":[{"family":"Stoll","given":"DR"},{"family":"Li","given":"XP"},{"family":"Wang","given":"XO"},{"family":"Carr","given":"PW"},{"family":"Porter","given":"SEG"},{"family":"Rutan","given":"SC"}],"citation-key":"stoll2007","container-title":"JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2007.08.054","ISSN":"0021-9673","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2007",10,19]]},"page":"3-43","title":"Fast, comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography","type":"article-journal","volume":"1168"},{"id":"stoll2017","abstract":"In this tutorial, we discuss the motivations for doing two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2D-LC) and describe the commonly used implementations of the method.

The SIMCA model classified all samples accurately (100%) into either the peaberry or normal coffee class, even at a 5% confidence level; however, the PLS-DA model also correctly classified all samples (100%). Investigation of the major wavelengths contributing to the classifications using x-loading weights and loading of latent variables (LVs) indicated wavelengths at 230, 250, 270, 310, and 350 nm were important for determination of the coffee types. These wavelengths were closely related to the absorbance wavelengths of several important chemical components in roasted coffee: caffeine, caffeic acid, and chlorogenic acids (CGA).

As a result of being able to utilise narrow bore RF columns, several significant factors have been highlighted, including high resolution post column derivatisation assays and an approximate five-fold decrease in the volume of reagents (mobile phase and PCD reagents) resulting in a reduced cost of the analysis in terms of purchase price and waste disposal.

In prior works reported in the literature, CUPRAC HPLC-PCD assays used large post column mixing coils leading to a deterioration in the observed separation efficiency. In this work we used the CUPRAC PCD assay with reaction flow (RF) chromatography. No reaction loop was required, thus preserving the efficiency of the separation. We subsequently compared the performance of the CUPRAC assay to that of an antioxidant assay that we have previously converted to RF chromatography, namely the ferric reducing antioxidant potential (FRAP) assay, both in RF mode. The relative response factor with respect to trolox was measured for both RF assays via the separation of a standard mixture of 16 compounds. Sample analysis of coffee and green tea via both RF assays was used to compare their ability to screen for bioactive candidates in complex natural products. In general, the CUPRAC assay is recommended as the RF PCD methodology of choice as it provided a higher level of performance compared to the FRAP assay, demonstrating less baseline noise interference, greater sensitivity, wider linear dynamic range and better assay precision.","archive_location":"WOS:000480374600100","author":[{"family":"Suktham","given":"T"},{"family":"Jones","given":"A"},{"family":"Soliven","given":"A"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"GR"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"suktham-ComparisonPerformanceCupric-2019","container-title":"MICROCHEMICAL JOURNAL","DOI":"10.1016/j.microc.2019.104046","ISSN":"0026-265X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",9]]},"language":"English","title":"A comparison of the performance of the cupric reducing antioxidant potential assay and the ferric reducing antioxidant power assay for the analysis of antioxidants using reaction flow chromatography","type":"article-journal","volume":"149"},{"id":"sulewska_AdvancedInstrumentalCharacterization_2021","abstract":"Coffee, with production exceeding 10.3 million tonnes in 2018, is one of the most widespread commodities consumed world-wide.

Results were compared with measurements for filter coffee made from the same coffee beans to better evaluate the effects of processing. In the coffee extracted at lower temperatures, a higher concentration of aroma compounds can be detected. This is particularly the case for compounds responsible for earthy (pyrazines) and woody (guaiacols) aroma notes. Also, for the coffee extracted at the highest temperature, a higher level of cyclotene giving undesired burnt and bready aroma is seen. The caffeine content in instant coffees was lower than in the filter coffee (49 ± 13 up to 62 ± 5 mg/100 mL brew for instant compared with 84 ± 15 mg/100 mL brew for filter coffee).

Although history does not change, its interpretation may. Therefore, I took the liberty to revisit the original work and added some of my new thoughts that could be interesting for the generation of scientists who are entering the intriguing arena of monoliths and may want to know the roots of the field. The current monolithic columns that are well applicable for efficient separations, were first described less than 30 years ago, and their advent represented the initial step to their present widespread appearance. At the beginning, the monolithic columns dominated the academic studies. However, several monolithic materials have later been materialized in commercial products. In order to stay within a reasonable size of this contribution, its focus is placed on developments achieved in the previous century. The very early reports are described in more detail since it might be difficult to find the original source.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,18]]},"author":[{"family":"Svec","given":"Frantisek"}],"citation-key":"svec2017","container-title":"ELECTROPHORESIS","DOI":"10.1002/elps.201700181","ISSN":"1522-2683","issue":"22-23","issued":{"date-parts":[["2017"]]},"language":"en","page":"2810-2820","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Monolithic columns: A historical overview","title-short":"Monolithic columns","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/elps.201700181","volume":"38"},{"id":"sweeney2001","archive_location":"WOS:000171372200002","author":[{"family":"Sweeney","given":"AP"},{"family":"Wyllie","given":"SG"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"sweeney2001","container-title":"JOURNAL OF LIQUID CHROMATOGRAPHY & RELATED TECHNOLOGIES","DOI":"10.1081/JLC-100106086","ISSN":"1082-6076","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2001"]]},"page":"2559-2581","title":"The separation of stereoisomers from oligomers of low molecular weight polystyrene on a carbon clad zirconia column using a reversed phase multidimensional HPLC system","type":"article-journal","volume":"24"},{"id":"sweeney2002","archive_location":"WOS:000177684800005","author":[{"family":"Sweeney","given":"AP"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"sweeney2002","container-title":"JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A","DOI":"10.1016/S0021-9673(02)00782-3","ISSN":"0021-9673","issue":"1-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2002",8,30]]},"page":"41-52","title":"Development of a two-dimensional liquid chromatography system with trapping and sample enrichment capabilities","type":"article-journal","volume":"968"},{"id":"sweigart2020","abstract":"If you've ever spent hours renaming files or updating hundreds of spreadsheet cells, you know how tedious tasks like these can be.

They generate large amounts of solid and liquid wastes (e.g., olive pomace, olive mill wastewater, grape pomace, grape stems, wine lees, and wine processing wastewater) that represent a major environmental problem. Consequently, the management of these residues has become a big challenge for these industries, since they are harmful to the environment but rich in bioactive compounds, such as polyphenols. In recent years, the recovery of phenolic compounds has been proposed as a smart strategy for the valorization of these by-products, from a circular economy perspective. This review aims to provide a comprehensive description of the state of the art of techniques available for the analysis, extraction, and purification of polyphenols from the olive mill and winery residues.

This rapid and sensitive approach for the analysis of street heroin was used to explore the chemistry of a proposed heroin screening test that is based on the relative response with these two chemiluminescence reagents using flow injection analysis. Although heroin was the major constituent of the six drug samples (between 16% and 67% by mass), the synthetic by-product 6-acetylcodeine (2.5-8.3%) made a greater contribution to the total [Ru(bipy)(3)](3+) chemiluminescence response of the screening test. The signal with permanganate was primarily due to the presence of 6-monoacetylmorphine (0.9-29%), and was therefore indicative of the degree of sample degradation during clandestine manufacture or poor storage conditions prior to the drug seizure. In the second part of the screening test, the sample is treated with sodium hydroxide, which results in a large increase in the signal with permanganate, due to the rapid hydrolysis of heroin to 6-monoacetylmorphine. As the emission of these two reagents with morphinan-alkaloids and their derivatives largely depends on the substituent at the O-3 position, the slower hydrolysis of 6-monoacetylmorphine to morphine, and 6-acetylcodeine to codeine, did not have a major impact on the characteristic pattern of responses in the screening test.

Free-solution capillary electrophoresis is a robust technique for the separation and characterization of both natural and synthetic complex charged polymers. In the case of polyelectrolytes, free-solution capillary electrophoresis is in the “critical conditions” (CE-CC): it allows their separation by factors other than molar mass for molar masses typically higher than 20000 g/mol. This method is thus complementary to size-exclusion chromatography (SEC). SEC is widely used to determine molar mass distributions and their dispersities. Utilizing CE-CC, an analogous calculation of dispersity based on the distributions of electrophoretic mobilities was derived and the heterogeneity of composition or branching in diﬀerent polysaccharides or synthetic polymers was obtained in a number of experimental cases. Calculations are based on a ratio of moments and could therefore be compared to simulations of polymerization processes, in analogy to the work performed on molar mass distributions. Among four possible types of dispersity, the most precise values were obtained with the calculation analogous with the dispersity of molar mass distribution Mw/Mn. In addition, the dispersity value allows conclusions based on a single value: the closer the dispersity is to 1, the more homogeneous the polymer is in terms of composition or branching. This approach allows the analysis of dispersity of important molecular attributes of polymers other than molar mass and aims at improving the overall molecular characterization of both synthetic and natural polymers. The dispersity can also be monitored online while performing a chemical reaction within the CE instrument.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Thevarajah","given":"Joel J."},{"family":"Sutton","given":"Adam T."},{"family":"Maniego","given":"Alison R."},{"family":"Whitty","given":"Elizabeth G."},{"family":"Harrisson","given":"Simon"},{"family":"Cottet","given":"Hervé"},{"family":"Castignolles","given":"Patrice"},{"family":"Gaborieau","given":"Marianne"}],"citation-key":"thevarajah2016","container-title":"Analytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal.

The accurate extraction of meaningful features and the building of discriminant models are two crucial steps in the data analysis pipeline of untargeted metabolomics. In this study, pure ion chromatograms were extracted from a liquor dataset and left-sided colon cancer (LCC) dataset by K-means-clustering-based Pure Ion Chromatogram extraction method version 2.0 (KPIC2). Then, the nonlinear low-dimensional embedding by uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) showed the separation of samples from different groups in reduced dimensions. The discriminant models were established by extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) based on the features extracted by KPIC2. Results showed that features extracted by KPIC2 achieved 100% classification accuracy on the test sets of the liquor dataset and the LCC dataset, which demonstrated the rationality of the XGBoost model based on KPIC2 compared with the results of XCMS (92% and 96% for liquor and LCC datasets respectively). Finally, XGBoost can achieve better performance than the linear method and traditional nonlinear modeling methods on these datasets. UMAP and XGBoost are integrated into KPIC2 package to extend its performance in complex situations, which are not only able to effectively process nonlinear dataset but also can greatly improve the accuracy of data analysis in non-target metabolomics.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Tian","given":"Miao"},{"family":"Lin","given":"Zhonglong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Xu"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Jing"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Wentao"},{"family":"Lu","given":"Hongmei"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Zhimin"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yi"}],"citation-key":"tian_2021","container-title":"Molecules","container-title-short":"Molecules","DOI":"10.3390/molecules26092715","ISSN":"1420-3049","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,5]]},"language":"en","page":"2715","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Pure Ion Chromatograms Combined with Advanced Machine Learning Methods Improve Accuracy of Discriminant Models in LC–MS-Based Untargeted Metabolomics","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/26/9/2715","volume":"26"},{"id":"tian_geometricsearchnew_2018","abstract":"PARAFAC2 is a powerful decomposition method which is ideally suited for modeling gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) data.

With the exception of pulse-modulated methods, separations have thus been limited to two dimensions. It is proposed that some of the limitations and shortcomings of these methods may be ameliorated or overcome by employing multi-dimensional detection whereby each analyte is effectively labelled in the frequency domain by a series of pulsed-injections, and a symmetrical, comprehensive online analysis performed with the resulting signal processed by sequential Fourier analysis. A semi-empirical computer model of this system was developed and its feasibility positively demonstrated in simulations of high-efficiency separations in two dimensions. Separations of higher dimensionality were shown to be possible but involved signal-processing challenges beyond the present work. By eliminating wrap-around effects and enabling the separation of physically unseparated peaks, the technique facilitates significant improvements in peak capacity per unit of analysis time as well as greatly improved signal to noise ratios. Because these comprehensive online multidimensional Fourier transform separations depend heavily upon the practical lifetime of imposed injection pulses, it is envisaged that this method will leverage emerging high-efficiency micro- and nanoscale separations technologies.

The emergence of novel platforms employing instrumentation of exceptional selectivity and sensitivity along with the use of advanced chemometrics such as NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance)- and MS (mass spectrometry)-based metabolomics is considered as a powerful asset towards wine authentication.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Tzachristas","given":"Alexandros"},{"family":"Pasvanka","given":"Konstantina"},{"family":"Calokerinos","given":"Antony"},{"family":"Proestos","given":"Charalampos"}],"citation-key":"tzachristas_polyphenolsnaturalantioxidants_2020","container-title":"Applied Sciences","container-title-short":"Applied Sciences","DOI":"10.3390/app10175908","ISSN":"2076-3417","issue":"17","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",8,26]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","number":"17","page":"5908","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Polyphenols: Natural Antioxidants to Be Used as a Quality Tool in Wine Authenticity","title-short":"Polyphenols","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2076-3417/10/17/5908","volume":"10"},{"id":"tzouros_agriculturalproducessynopsis_2001","abstract":"A review of quality control methods and applications of multivariate statistical techniques on the authentication and classification of agricultural products is presented.

This modification makes the assay less susceptible to artefacts, e.g. influence on the radical generation process. For most antioxidants tested, a biphasic reaction pattern was seen, i.e. a fast and slow scavenging rate. We evaluated application of the assay with both lipophilic and hydrophilic compounds with antioxidant capacity. Several organic solvents, compatible with water, were tested with α-tocopherol, quercetin and β-carotene. It was found that the TEACs differed in various solvents. Under standardized conditions additivity of TEACs obtained from individual antioxidants could be demonstrated.

Three percent of participants were lost to follow-up. From age 25 years, the median survival was 19.9 years (95% CI, 18.5 to 21.3) among patients with HIV infection and 51.1 years (CI, 50.9 to 51.5) among the general population. For HIV-infected patients, survival increased to 32.5 years (CI, 29.4 to 34.7) during the 2000 to 2005 period. In the subgroup that excluded persons with known hepatitis C coinfection (16%), median survival was 38.9 years (CI, 35.4 to 40.1) during this same period. The relative mortality rates for patients with HIV infection compared with those for the general population decreased with increasing age, whereas the excess mortality rate increased with increasing age. Limitations: The observed mortality rates are assumed to apply beyond the current maximum observation time of 10 years.\nConclusions: The estimated median survival is more than 35 years for a young person diagnosed with HIV infection in the late highly active antiretroviral therapy era.

These tannins have different interactions with proteins as well as with wine components such as anthocyanins and other phenolics in wine. The suppliers of commercial tannins often emphasise that these products can stabilise colour in red wine and influence the mouthfeel of the wine, among other things.

The AA values derived from the various methods used were correlated. Roasting resulted in the degradation of 5-CQA and formation of melanoidins, while AA was largely unaffected by roasting. The extraction of soluble coffee more prominently affected the AA of light-roasted coffee, mainly because it favoured the extraction of 5-CQA. The larger caffeine content in robusta coffee resulted in greater AA.

However, these polymers are inherently difficult to characterize due to their significant heterogeneity regarding molar mass and chemical composition (degree of substitution, DS). The present study describes the development of a comprehensive online two-dimensional liquid chromatography (2DLC) approach to characterize hyaluronic acid and its acrylate derivatives (DS ranging from 0.4 to 3.1) in terms of molar mass and degree of substitution. In the first dimension of the 2D-LC method, separation according to chemical composition/DS was achieved by using a stepwise solvent gradient and a reversed phase C8 column. Fractions from the first dimension were automatically transferred to the second dimension comprising size exclusion chromatographic separation of the fractions according to molar mass. It was found that the hyaluronic acid derivatives were broadly distributed with regard to both chemical composition and molar mass. Fractions with different degrees of substitution were identified, and their molar mass distributions were determined. The study proved that comprehensive 2D-LC is a powerful approach to reveal the complex nature of hyaluronic acid and its derivatives.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Viktor","given":"Zanelle"},{"family":"Farcet","given":"Céline"},{"family":"Moire","given":"Claudine"},{"family":"Brothier","given":"Fabien"},{"family":"Pfukwa","given":"Helen"},{"family":"Pasch","given":"Harald"}],"citation-key":"viktor2019","container-title":"Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal Bioanal Chem","DOI":"10.1007/s00216-019-01799-x","ISSN":"1618-2642, 1618-2650","issue":"15","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",6]]},"language":"en","page":"3321-3330","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography for the characterization of acrylate-modified hyaluronic acid","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00216-019-01799-x","volume":"411"},{"id":"villalon-lopez_1HNMRbasedMetabolomic_2018","abstract":"The present non-targeted 1H NMR-based ﬁngerprinting approach along with multivariate analysis established diﬀerences between representative aqueous extracts of commercial ground roasted coﬀee (GRC) and instant (soluble) coﬀee (IC) samples.

After illustrating their potential and limitations, we introduce the possibility of exploiting DNA analysis as a further strategy to ascertain the varietal origin of wines. In the second part of the paper we present some results of our efforts to differentiate wines from three Aglianico biotypes, based on the molecules previously discussed. Aglianico is one of the most ancient red grapes cultivated in southern Italy, producing three highly prized PDO wines.

The ABTS•+ radical was generated enzymatically using a horseradish peroxidase and hydrogen peroxide. The presence of wine phenolic compounds caused the absorbance of the radical to decay at 414 nm. The measurement conditions were optimised. The total phenolic content of wines ranged from 1262 to 2389 mg l−1 for red wines and 70 to 407 mg l−1 for white wines, expressed as gallic acid equivalents. The phenolic content of Sherry wines was similar to that of white wines. Optimum dilutions for white and Sherry wines were set up as a function of their total phenolic content (for total phenol index, TPI < 300 mg gallic acid per liter, dilution 2.5:10 to 5:10; for TPI > 300 mg gallic acid per liter, dilution 1:10 to 3:10). Red wines absorb at the wavelength of measurement and dilutions between 0.35:10 and 0.1:10 are advisable. Reaction kinetics were also monitored and the antioxidant activity, expressed as Trolox Equivalent Antioxidant Capacity (TEAC), was determined at 2 and 15 min of reaction. The mean values for TEAC2 min were 5.01 ± 1.40 mM for red wines, 0.46 ± 0.32 mM for white wines and 0.26 ± 0.19 mM for Sherry wines. At 15 min, mean values were 6.93 ± 2.41 mM for red wines, 0.67 ± 0.47 mM for white wines and 0.26 ± 0.19 mM for Sherry wines. The correlation coefﬁcients were better at 2 min (r = 0.9012) than at 15 min (r = 0.8462) when compared with TPI. Hence, TEAC2 min seems to be a more appropriate measure.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Villaño","given":"D."},{"family":"Fernández-Pachón","given":"M.S."},{"family":"Troncoso","given":"A.M."},{"family":"Garcı́a-Parrilla","given":"M.C."}],"citation-key":"villano2004","container-title":"Talanta","container-title-short":"Talanta","DOI":"10.1016/j.talanta.2004.03.021","ISSN":"00399140","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",10,8]]},"language":"en","page":"501-509","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The antioxidant activity of wines determined by the ABTS+ method: influence of sample dilution and time","title-short":"The antioxidant activity of wines determined by the ABTS+ method","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0039914004001134","volume":"64"},{"id":"virdis_2021","abstract":"Currently, the main role of Lactic Acid Bacteria (LAB) in wine is to conduct the malolactic fermentation (MLF). This process can increase wine aroma and mouthfeel, improve microbial stability and reduce the acidity of wine. A growing number of studies support the appreciation that LAB can also significantly, positively and negatively, contribute to the sensorial profile of wine through many different enzymatic pathways. This is achieved either through the synthesis of compounds such as diacetyl and esters or by liberating bound aroma compounds such as glycoside-bound primary aromas and volatile thiols which are odorless in their bound form. LAB can also liberate hydroxycinnamic acids from their tartaric esters and have the potential to break down anthocyanin glucosides, thus impacting wine color. LAB can also produce enzymes with the potential to help in the winemaking process and contribute to stabilizing the final product. For example, LAB exhibit peptidolytic and proteolytic activity that could break down the proteins causing wine haze, potentially reducing the need for bentonite addition. Other potential contributions include pectinolytic activity, which could aid juice clarification and the ability to break down acetaldehyde, even when bound to SO\n              2\n              , reducing the need for SO\n              2\n              additions during winemaking. Considering all these findings, this review summarizes the novel enzymatic activities of LAB that positively or negatively affect the quality of wine. Inoculation strategies, LAB improvement strategies, their potential to be used as targeted additions, and technological advances involving their use in wine are highlighted along with suggestions for future research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,9]]},"author":[{"family":"Virdis","given":"Carla"},{"family":"Sumby","given":"Krista"},{"family":"Bartowsky","given":"Eveline"},{"family":"Jiranek","given":"Vladimir"}],"citation-key":"virdis_2021","container-title":"Frontiers in Microbiology","container-title-short":"Front.

The first-dimension separations were carried out by either reversed-phase chromatography or strong anion exchange chromatography. The second-dimension separation was in all cases reversed-phase capillary LC. In case of two-dimensional reversed/reversed-phase separations, some degree of orthogonality was achieved by using either two different sets of mobile phase solvents and one reversed-phase capillary LC column or a single set of mobile phases and two capillary LC columns packed with different-reversed-phase stationary phases.

The reporting of such research is often inadequate, which hampers the assessment of its strengths and weaknesses and of a study’s generalizability. The Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) Initiative developed recommendations on what should be included in an accurate and complete report of an observational study. We deﬁned the scope of the recommendations to cover three main study designs: cohort, caseecontrol, and cross-sectional studies. We convened a 2-day workshop in September 2004, with methodologists, researchers, and journal editors to draft a checklist of items. This list was subsequently revised during several meetings of the coordinating group and in e-mail discussions with the larger group of STROBE contributors, taking into account empirical evidence and methodological considerations. The workshop and the subsequent iterative process of consultation and revision resulted in a checklist of 22 items (the STROBE Statement) that relate to the title, abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of articles. Eighteen items are common to all three study designs and four are speciﬁc for cohort, caseecontrol, or cross-sectional studies.

There is a paucity of data on malnutrition in patients admitted with COVID-19. Methods: This is a retrospective cohort study consisting of 4311 COVID-19 adult (18 years and older) inpatients at 5 Johns Hopkinsafﬁliated hospitals between 1 March and 3 December 2020. Malnourishment was identiﬁed using the malnutrition universal screening tool (MUST), then conﬁrmed by registered dietitians. Statistics were conducted with SAS v9.4 (Cary, NC, USA) software to examine the effect of malnutrition on mortality and hospital length of stay among COVID-19 inpatient encounters, while accounting for possible covariates in regression analysis predicting mortality or the log-transformed length of stay. Results: COVID-19 patients who were older, male, or had lower BMIs had a higher likelihood of mortality. Patients with malnutrition were 76% more likely to have mortality (p < 0.001) and to have a 105% longer hospital length of stay (p < 0.001). Overall, 12.9% (555/4311) of adult COVID-19 patients were diagnosed with malnutrition and were associated with an 87.9% increase in hospital length of stay (p < 0.001). Conclusions: In a cohort of COVID-19 adult inpatients, malnutrition was associated with a higher likelihood of mortality and increased hospital length of stay.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Vong","given":"Tyrus"},{"family":"Yanek","given":"Lisa R."},{"family":"Wang","given":"Lin"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Huimin"},{"family":"Fan","given":"Christopher"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Elinor"},{"family":"Oh","given":"Sun Jung"},{"family":"Szvarca","given":"Daniel"},{"family":"Kim","given":"Ahyoung"},{"family":"Potter","given":"James J."},{"family":"Mullin","given":"Gerard E."}],"citation-key":"vong-MalnutritionIncreasesHospital-2022","container-title":"Nutrients","container-title-short":"Nutrients","DOI":"10.3390/nu14061310","ISSN":"2072-6643","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3,21]]},"language":"en","page":"1310","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Malnutrition Increases Hospital Length of Stay and Mortality among Adult Inpatients with COVID-19","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2072-6643/14/6/1310","volume":"14"},{"id":"vosough_2013","abstract":"The present work focuses on the application of multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) for analysis of five important antibiotics (sulfamethoxazole, metronidazole, chloramphenicol, sulfadizine and sulfamerazine) in highly complex wastewater samples, using solid phase extraction (SPE)-high performance liquid chromatography with diode-array detection (HPLC-DAD) on a short column, regarding the fast elution methodology. The samples were pre-concentrated on Bond Elut-ENV cartridges and separated on an ODS column (7cm) in less than 4min using an isocratic mode of elution with methanol–water (55:45, v/v) at pH=3.2. Due to the matrix interferences and the resulting sensitivity changes, a strategy implementing standard addition calibration in combination with MCR/ALS algorithm was applied. In this paper, the signal corresponding to background contribution was considered as a systematic part of the model during MCR/ALS data processing, so the background correction step was not necessary. The qualitative and quantitative results showed that the application of MCR/ALS algorithm in the traditional chromatographic method was appropriately able to resolve highly drifted background constituents as well as heavily overlapped peaks among the analytes and also between the analytes and the matrix interferences. Recoveries were ranged from 69.6% to 120.3% with relative standard deviations of less than or equal to 11.0% and showed the acceptable performance of the method. Additionally, statistical t-test as well as computed elliptical joint confidence region (EJCR) confirmed the accuracy of the proposed method and indicated the absence of both constant and proportional errors in the predicted concentrations. The results well explained that the second-order advantage for analytes was achieved in samples containing one or more uncalibrated components, which strongly related to wastewater samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Vosough","given":"Maryam"},{"family":"Mashhadiabbas Esfahani","given":"Hadi"}],"citation-key":"vosough_2013","container-title":"Talanta","container-title-short":"Talanta","DOI":"10.1016/j.talanta.2013.03.049","ISSN":"0039-9140","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",9,15]]},"page":"68-75","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Fast HPLC-DAD quantification procedure for selected sulfonamids, metronidazole and chloramphenicol in wastewaters using second-order calibration based on MCR-ALS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0039914013001987","volume":"113"},{"id":"vrhovsek_VersatileTargetedMetabolomics_2012","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,22]]},"author":[{"family":"Vrhovsek","given":"Urska"},{"family":"Masuero","given":"Domenico"},{"family":"Gasperotti","given":"Mattia"},{"family":"Franceschi","given":"Pietro"},{"family":"Caputi","given":"Lorenzo"},{"family":"Viola","given":"Roberto"},{"family":"Mattivi","given":"Fulvio"}],"citation-key":"vrhovsek_VersatileTargetedMetabolomics_2012","container-title":"Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry","container-title-short":"J.

Resources obtained through fraudulent means are likely to be viewed as unearned gains and are less likely to be invested in productive activities, such as recruiting talent. We posit that honest and fraudulent companies also invest in different types of innovation: honest firms pursue technically significant innovations, while fraudulent companies are likely to make smaller investments in less challenging inventive opportunities that contribute to the appearance rather than the substance of innovation. We test these predictions in a longitudinal dataset tracking the personnel recruitment and patenting activities of 467 Chinese high technology firms, all of which applied for state-funded innovation grants. We identify fraud by comparing two sets of financial books prepared by each company in the data in the same fiscal year, which are legally required to be identical but are discrepant in over 50 percent of cases, in a direction that benefits the firm. We find that relative to honest companies, fraudulent firms are more likely to receive state grants and are less likely to recruit new employees or produce important inventions in the post-grant period.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Yanbo"},{"family":"Stuart","given":"Toby"},{"family":"Li","given":"Jizhen"}],"citation-key":"wang2021","container-title":"Administrative Science Quarterly","container-title-short":"Administrative Science Quarterly","DOI":"10.1177/0001839220927350","ISSN":"0001-8392, 1930-3815","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",6]]},"language":"en","page":"267-297","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Fraud and Innovation","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0001839220927350","volume":"66"},{"id":"warrener2020","abstract":"The issue of counterfeit bottles may seem far from home, affecting only the oldest and rarest wines in the world.

Analytical instruments equipped with automated samplers yield large amounts of measurement data, which needs to be verified and analyzed. Since nearly every GC/MS instrument vendor offers its own data format and software tools, the consequences are problems with data exchange and a lack of comparability between the analytical results. To challenge this situation a number of either commercial or non-profit software applications have been developed. These applications provide functionalities to import and analyze several data formats but have shortcomings in terms of the transparency of the implemented analytical algorithms and/or are restricted to a specific computer platform.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,26]]},"author":[{"family":"Wenig","given":"Philip"},{"family":"Odermatt","given":"Juergen"}],"citation-key":"wenig_2010","container-title":"BMC Bioinformatics","container-title-short":"BMC Bioinformatics","DOI":"10.1186/1471-2105-11-405","ISSN":"1471-2105","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",7,30]]},"page":"405","source":"BioMed Central","title":"OpenChrom: a cross-platform open source software for the mass spectrometric analysis of chromatographic data","title-short":"OpenChrom","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2105-11-405","volume":"11"},{"id":"west_CurrentTrendsSupercritical_2018","abstract":"Supercritical fluid chromatography (SFC), which employs pressurized carbon dioxide as the major component of the mobile phase, has been known for several decades but has faced a significant resurgence of interest in the recent years, thanks to the development of modern instruments to comply with current expectations in terms of robustness and sensitivity. This review is focused on the recent literature, specifically since the introduction of modern systems but in relation to older literature, to identify the changing trends in application domains. Typically, natural products, bioanalysis, food science, and environmental analyses are all strongly increasing. Together with reduced extra-column volumes in the instruments, the advent of sub-2-μm particles and superficially porous particles in the stationary phases is favoring ultra-high-performance SFC (UHPSFC) allowing for improved resolution and faster analyses, but without the constraints of viscous liquids encountered in ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography (UHPLC). Hyphenation to mass spectrometry is also more frequent and opened the way to new application domains, and raises different issues from liquid chromatography mobile phases, especially due to decompression of carbon dioxide. It is also shown that the frontiers between SFC and HPLC are fading, as switching from one method to the other, even within the course of a single analysis, is facilitated my modern instruments. The present review is not intended to be exhaustive but rather giving a snapshot of recent trends in supercritical fluid chromatography, based on the observation of about 500 papers published in English-written peer-reviewed journals from 2014 to 2018.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",8,7]]},"author":[{"family":"West","given":"Caroline"}],"citation-key":"west_CurrentTrendsSupercritical_2018","container-title":"Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry","container-title-short":"Anal Bioanal Chem","DOI":"10.1007/s00216-018-1267-4","ISSN":"1618-2642, 1618-2650","issue":"25","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",10]]},"language":"en","page":"6441-6457","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Current trends in supercritical fluid chromatography","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://link.springer.com/10.1007/s00216-018-1267-4","volume":"410"},{"id":"west_HowGoodSFC_2013","author":[{"family":"West","given":"Caroline"}],"citation-key":"west_HowGoodSFC_2013","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013"]]},"language":"en","page":"6","source":"Zotero","title":"How Good is SFC for Polar Analytes?","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"westernmres","abstract":"RD1 V-8\nIn this video we continue thinking about the role of notes in research, how to think about a taxonomy of your note types, and how to make notes while reading literature (more on that in the next video).","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,23]]},"citation-key":"westernmres","dimensions":"44:10","director":[{"literal":"WesternMRes"}],"source":"YouTube","title":"Notetaking for Mastering and Managing Knowledge","type":"motion_picture","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T_UaAVUDToE&t=467s"},{"id":"westernmresa","abstract":"Recording of the 4pm workshop for the MRes core unit, Researcher Development 1.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",7,23]]},"citation-key":"westernmresa","dimensions":"1:50:57","director":[{"literal":"WesternMRes"}],"source":"YouTube","title":"RD1 Week 1 - Managing Your Reading","type":"motion_picture","URL":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB8fdnnK1aE"},{"id":"wheal_ApplicationMultiIsotopeCalibration_2021","abstract":"The relatively new multi-isotope calibration (MICal) method was applied to wine samples, measuring elements with potential impacts in sensory perception, wine production and the authentication of origin.

Elements in the trace range (100-5000 µg L-1: Cu, Fe, Sr and Zn) and ultra-trace range (1-10 µg L-1: Cr, Ni, Pb and Sn) were analysed by ICP-MS and results from MICal were compared to conventional internal standard (ISTD) calibration measurements. Analysis of three wines (a red, white and rosé) for Fe and Cu by MICal yielded concentrations that were 100-112% of concentrations established by consensus through a proficency testing program, but with much less variability than concentrations measured by either ISTD or consensus results. The same wines spiked with Cu, Fe, Sr and Zn yielded recoveries of 80-106%.

The specificity of an AOC product is determined by the combination of a physical and biological environment with established production techniques transmitted within a human community. Together, these give the product its distinctive qualities. \nThe defining technical and geographic factors are set forth in standards for each product, including wines, cheeses and meats. Other countries and the European Union have similar labeling systems. The European Union's protected designation of origin (PDO and PGI) system has harmonized the protection of all geographical indications and their registration.

The collection is often a set of results from an experiment, an observational study, or a survey. The term \"arithmetic mean\" is preferred in some mathematics and statistics contexts because it helps distinguish it from other types of means, such as geometric and harmonic.\nIn addition to mathematics and statistics, the arithmetic mean is frequently used in economics, anthropology, history, and almost every academic field to some extent. For example, per capita income is the arithmetic average income of a nation's population.\nWhile the arithmetic mean is often used to report central tendencies, it is not a robust statistic: it is greatly influenced by outliers (values much larger or smaller than most others). For skewed distributions, such as the distribution of income for which a few people's incomes are substantially higher than most people's, the arithmetic mean may not coincide with one's notion of \"middle\". In that case, robust statistics, such as the median, may provide a better description of central tendency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,5]]},"citation-key":"wiki_arithmeticmean_2024","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,8]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1217857842","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Arithmetic mean","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Arithmetic_mean&oldid=1217857842"},{"id":"wikipedia_equation_solving","abstract":"In mathematics, to solve an equation is to find its solutions, which are the values (numbers, functions, sets, etc.) that fulfill the condition stated by the equation, consisting generally of two expressions related by an equals sign. When seeking a solution, one or more variables are designated as unknowns. A solution is an assignment of values to the unknown variables that makes the equality in the equation true. In other words, a solution is a value or a collection of values (one for each unknown) such that, when substituted for the unknowns, the equation becomes an equality.\nA solution of an equation is often called a root of the equation, particularly but not only for polynomial equations. The set of all solutions of an equation is its solution set.\nAn equation may be solved either numerically or symbolically. Solving an equation numerically means that only numbers are admitted as solutions. Solving an equation symbolically means that expressions can be used for representing the solutions.\nFor example, the equation x + y = 2x – 1 is solved for the unknown x by the expression x = y + 1, because substituting y + 1 for x in the equation results in (y + 1) + y = 2(y + 1) – 1, a true statement. It is also possible to take the variable y to be the unknown, and then the equation is solved by y = x – 1. Or x and y can both be treated as unknowns, and then there are many solutions to the equation; a symbolic solution is (x, y) = (a + 1, a), where the variable a may take any value. Instantiating a symbolic solution with specific numbers gives a numerical solution; for example, a = 0 gives (x, y) = (1, 0) (that is, x = 1, y = 0), and a = 1 gives (x, y) = (2, 1). \nThe distinction between known variables and unknown variables is generally made in the statement of the problem, by phrases such as \"an equation in x and y\", or \"solve for x and y\", which indicate the unknowns, here x and y.\nHowever, it is common to reserve x, y, z, ... to denote the unknowns, and to use a, b, c, ... to denote the known variables, which are often called parameters. This is typically the case when considering polynomial equations, such as quadratic equations. However, for some problems, all variables may assume either role.\nDepending on the context, solving an equation may consist to find either any solution (finding a single solution is enough), all solutions, or a solution that satisfies further properties, such as belonging to a given interval. When the task is to find the solution that is the best under some criterion, this is an optimization problem. Solving an optimization problem is generally not referred to as \"equation solving\", as, generally, solving methods start from a particular solution for finding a better solution, and repeating the process until finding eventually the best solution.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,7]]},"citation-key":"wikipedia_equation_solving","container-title":"Wikipedia","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5,20]]},"language":"en","license":"Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License","note":"Page Version ID: 1224784344","source":"Wikipedia","title":"Equation solving","type":"entry-encyclopedia","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Equation_solving&oldid=1224784344"},{"id":"wikipedia2004","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",2,6]]},"author":[{"family":"wikipedia","given":""}],"citation-key":"wikipedia2004","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",5,8]]},"title":"Analysis of variance - Wikipedia","type":"webpage","URL":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance"},{"id":"wikipedia2021","abstract":"The Folin–Ciocâlteu reagent (FCR) or Folin's phenol reagent or Folin–Denis reagent, also called the gallic acid equivalence method (GAE), is a mixture of phosphomolybdate  and phosphotungstate used for the colorimetric in vitro assay of phenolic and polyphenolic antioxidants.

It is therefore essential that we have robust approaches to evaluate how anthropogenic perturbation affects soil quality and the delivery of these services. Metabolomics, the large-scale study of low molecular weight organic compounds in soil, offers one potential approach to characterise soils and evaluate the metabolic status of the soil biological community. The aims of the present study were to 1) characterise the soil metabolome across a contrasting range of soil types, 2) understand the relationships between common chemical and physical soil quality indicators and its metabolome, and 3) evaluate the discriminatory power of soil metabolomics and its potential use as a soil quality indicator. Nine different topsoils with 5 replications were collected along an altitudinal primary productivity gradient encompassing a wide range of soil types and land uses. Metabolites were extracted from soil using 3:3:2 (v/v/v) acetonitrile:isopropanol:water and individual compounds identified using a gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) platform. Overall, 405 individual compounds were detected, of which 146 were positively identified, including sugars, amino acids, organic acids, nucleobases, sugar alcohols, lipids and a range of secondary metabolites. The concentration and profile of metabolites was found to vary greatly between the soil types. Further, the soils' metabolomic fingerprints correlated to a number of environmental factors, including pH, land-use, moisture and salinity. We also tentatively attributed soil-specific metabolites to potential functional pathways, although complementary proteomic, genomic and transcriptomic approaches would be needed to provide definitive supporting evidence. In conclusion, soil metabolomics offers the potential to reveal the complex molecular networks and metabolic pathways operating in the soil microbial community and a means of evaluating soil function. Further work is now required to benchmark soil metabolomes under a wide range of management regimes so that they can be used for the quantitative assessment of soil quality.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",5,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Withers","given":"Emma"},{"family":"Hill","given":"Paul W."},{"family":"Chadwick","given":"David R."},{"family":"Jones","given":"Davey L."}],"citation-key":"withers_UseUntargetedMetabolomics_2020","container-title":"Soil Biology & Biochemistry","container-title-short":"Soil Biol.

Using self-congruency theory, the purpose of this paper is to develop a conceptual framework of the perceptions of, and motivation for, luxury wine consumption.\n            \n            \n              Design/methodology/approach\n              Using a scoping review approach, the current literature on luxury wine and luxury branded products is analyzed for existing gaps in understanding luxury wine consumption.\n            \n            \n              Findings\n              The conceptualization of luxury wine along with the perceptions, motivators and indicators for wine consumption are currently underdeveloped. This paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding what drives perceptions and motivators of luxury wine consumption.\n            \n            \n              Originality/value\n              Emerging from a scoping review of extant literature, this paper proposes a conceptual framework for understanding consumers’ perceptions of luxury wine and motivations for consumption. This framework will enable a better understanding of the dynamics of luxury wine consumption.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",10,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Wolf","given":"Hannah L."},{"family":"Morrish","given":"Sussie C."},{"family":"Fountain","given":"Joanna"}],"citation-key":"wolf_2016","container-title":"International Journal of Wine Business Research","container-title-short":"IJWBR","DOI":"10.1108/IJWBR-09-2015-0038","ISSN":"1751-1062","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2016",6,20]]},"language":"en","page":"120-133","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A conceptualization of the perceptions and motivators that drive luxury wine consumption","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJWBR-09-2015-0038/full/html","volume":"28"},{"id":"wong2004","archive_location":"WOS:000220935500004","author":[{"family":"Wong","given":"V"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"}],"citation-key":"wong2004","container-title":"JOURNAL OF CHROMATOGRAPHY A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2004.02.003","ISSN":"0021-9673","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2004",5,14]]},"page":"15-24","title":"Isolation of the active constituents in natural materials by 'heart-cutting' isocratic reversed-phase two-dimensional liquid chromatography","type":"article-journal","volume":"1036"},{"id":"worldtradeorganization_Illicittradefood_2024","citation-key":"worldtradeorganization_Illicittradefood_2024","collection-title":"WTO publications","editor":[{"literal":"World Trade Organization"}],"event-place":"Geneva, Switzerland","ISBN":"978-92-870-7547-5 978-92-870-7548-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"eng","number-of-pages":"88","publisher":"WTO","publisher-place":"Geneva, Switzerland","source":"K10plus ISBN","title":"Illicit trade in food and food fraud","type":"book"},{"id":"wrenn2009","abstract":"Educators in professional degree programs are charged with multiple responsibilities in the classroom and in practice settings. We apply our professional knowledge in a variety of settings to serve our communities; we reflect on how to improve practice from our experiences in these settings; we observe our students engaging in learning experiences in the classroom; and we share with our students the knowledge we've gained from our experiences and our scholarship within our profession. To accomplish these actions we must serve as both teacher and learner in both classroom and field. Moreover, we want our students to also benefit from the active learning processes of applying, reflecting, sharing, and observing both in and out of the classroom while also functioning as both learners and teachers. Although we can accomplish all these goals over an entire curriculum, this article seeks to provide an example of one teacher's attempt to achieve these goals within a single Social Work course in Death and Grief. A model is provided that demonstrates how the interactive process works for both the teacher and students in this course and could be adapted for use in other courses incorporating practice settings as part of the curricula. Educators in professional or service-related fields desire their students not only to learn theory and understand why theories are important but also to learn how to apply the theoretical frameworks in practice. Too often we hear anecdotal accounts of students in internships who are unable to make this transition from theory to practice with confidence and effectiveness. Perhaps the difficulty in making the transition from theory to practice arises, at least in part, from a failure of the teacher to integrate both theory and practice into the same course in the curriculum in ways that are relevant and meaningful to the student. Such integration helps students to more closely associate the practical value of learning theoretical concepts. It is imperative that students in professional programs be able to put into practice what they have learned in the classroom. As Hutchings (1990) wrote, \"What's at stake is the capacity to perform, to put what one knows into practice (p. 1).\" To help students become capable and competent practitioners requires that they have training in self-awareness, knowledge acquisition, and skill building (Kramer, 1998). According to Shebib (2003), practitioners need to have skills in four areas: relationship building, exploring or probing, empowering, and challenging. An essential additional skill is the ability to gain and utilize knowledge from practice (Dorfman, 1996). Mendenhall (2007) says that in order for students to develop these skills, education at the master's level, as well as practical experience, is necessary and expected. What can we do in our classrooms to increase student success, not only in their internships but most importantly in work settings following graduation? How can we use classroom teaching to enhance the ability of students to put what they've learned into practice, and how can we use that improved practice to enhance classroom learning? As Fiszer (2004) states in his book How Teachers Learn Best, \"The resulting data point to the need for an ongoing professional development model that directly connects training and practice\" (p. 1). It is the goal of this article to describe how this classroom/practice/classroom process can be incorporated into a curriculum via an enhanced learning model, even in courses not centered on clinical, internship, or service-learning requirements. The course used to illustrate this process is a course in Death and Grief in Contemporary Society taught at an accredited BSW/MSW Social Work program at a private university in the Midwest section of the United States. Before describing the process, we will discuss the value of integrating practical experience into a curriculum and discuss the learning methods upon which the model is based.","author":[{"family":"Wrenn","given":"Jan"},{"family":"Wrenn","given":"Bruce"}],"citation-key":"wrenn2009","container-title":"International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education","container-title-short":"International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009",1,1]]},"source":"ResearchGate","title":"Enhancing Learning by Integrating Theory and Practice","type":"article-journal","volume":"21"},{"id":"wright_2023","abstract":"Purpose – This paper aims to review and map the landscape of luxury wine consumption in multidisciplinary literature.

Given the high complexity of the wine samples and the co-elution problems during chromatographic separation, multivariate curve resolution-alternating least squares (MCR-ALS) was utilized to extract pure chromatographic and spectral profiles of each co-eluted compound. Quantification of phenolic compounds was thus achieved even in the presence of overlapping peaks and uncalibrated interferents. The quantitative data of the phenolic compounds in wines provided by the MCR-ALS algorithm were afterwards analyzed by unsupervised principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA) methods and supervised orthogonal partial least squares-discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA) method. Both PCA and HCA results showed that the thirty red wines from different geographical origins could be obviously distinguished, and the OPLS-DA could successfully predict the geographical origins of red wines.

However, it is difficult to rapidly and accurately analyze low concentrations of AA with currently available methods. In the present study, we introduce a highly sensitive method that enables the determination of AA in beverages, grains, and confectioneries by supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (SFC/MS/MS). The sensitivity of the SFC/MS/MS technique is 11-times higher than that obtained by ultra-high performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. We demonstrated that the highly sensitive SFC/MS/MS method was able to quantify low concentrations of AA in beverages (i.e., roasted barley tea and coffee) extracts at less than 10 µg kg−1 level without solid-phase purification. Furthermore, the simplification of the sample preparation procedure provided an improvement in data acquisition time (60 samples per 12 h). In conclusion, the developed analytical system is a potentially useful tool for practical AA determination.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Yoshioka","given":"Toshiaki"},{"family":"Izumi","given":"Yoshihiro"},{"family":"Nagatomi","given":"Yasushi"},{"family":"Miyamoto","given":"Yasuhisa"},{"family":"Suzuki","given":"Koji"},{"family":"Bamba","given":"Takeshi"}],"citation-key":"yoshioka_HighlySensitiveDetermination_2019","container-title":"Food Chemistry","container-title-short":"Food Chemistry","DOI":"10.1016/j.foodchem.2019.05.033","ISSN":"03088146","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10]]},"language":"en","page":"486-492","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A highly sensitive determination method for acrylamide in beverages, grains, and confectioneries by supercritical fluid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0308814619308283","volume":"294"},{"id":"yu_acceleratingparafac2algorithms_2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Huiwen"},{"family":"Augustijn","given":"Dillen"},{"family":"Bro","given":"Rasmus"}],"citation-key":"yu_acceleratingparafac2algorithms_2021","container-title":"Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems","container-title-short":"Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.chemolab.2021.104312","ISSN":"01697439","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",7]]},"language":"en","page":"104312","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Accelerating PARAFAC2 algorithms for non-negative complex tensor decomposition","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169743921000800","volume":"214"},{"id":"yu_parafac2localminima_2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,30]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Huiwen"},{"family":"Bro","given":"Rasmus"}],"citation-key":"yu_parafac2localminima_2021","container-title":"Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems","container-title-short":"Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems","DOI":"10.1016/j.chemolab.2021.104446","ISSN":"01697439","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"language":"en","page":"104446","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"PARAFAC2 and local minima","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0169743921002148","volume":"219"},{"id":"yu-ChromatographicBackgroundDrift-2013","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",7,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Yu","given":"Yong-Jie"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Hai-Long"},{"family":"Fu","given":"Hai-Yan"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Juan"},{"family":"Li","given":"Yuan-Na"},{"family":"Li","given":"Shu-Fang"},{"family":"Kang","given":"Chao"},{"family":"Yu","given":"Ru-Qin"}],"citation-key":"yu-ChromatographicBackgroundDrift-2013","container-title":"Journal of Chromatography A","container-title-short":"Journal of Chromatography A","DOI":"10.1016/j.chroma.2013.06.009","ISSN":"00219673","issued":{"date-parts":[["2013",8]]},"language":"en","page":"72-80","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Chromatographic background drift correction coupled with parallel factor analysis to resolve coelution problems in three-dimensional chromatographic data: Quantification of eleven antibiotics in tap water samples by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with a diode array detector","title-short":"Chromatographic background drift correction coupled with parallel factor analysis to resolve coelution problems in three-dimensional chromatographic data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0021967313009047","volume":"1302"},{"id":"yuan_SimultaneousDeterminationCarbendazim_2019","abstract":"A novel fluorescence application for simultaneous determination of two common fungicide pesticides (carbendazim and chlorothalonil) in peanut oil is presented. Using the strategy of combining excitation-emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence with three-way calibration methods, the proposed approach successfully achieved quantitative analysis of carbendazim and chlorothalonil pesticide residues in peanut oil, even with highly overlapped spectra. It needs little preparation, using \"mathematical separation\" instead of \"analytical separation\" to achieve concentration prediction of target analytes in complex systems. Each analyte was performed using fluorescence spectroscopy after instrument spectral correction and scatter removal. Then the data were modeled with two three-way calibration algorithms, including alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD) and alternating penalty trilinear decomposition (APTLD). The results indicated that APTLD performed slightly better than ATLD for this system. The carbendazim and chlorothalonil can be recognized simultaneously with the correlation coefficients all above 0.96 between resolved spectra and actual spectra. Satisfactory results have been achieved with the average recoveries (mean ± standard deviation) of carbendazim and chlorothalonil being 100.2 ± 6.7% and 99.7 ± 6.7%, respectively. Moreover, as for carbendazim and chlorothalonil, the sensitivity (SENs) are 1.50 × 102 and 3.80 × 102 mL ng-1, the limits of detection (LODs) are 11 ng mL-1 and 4.3 ng mL-1, the limit of quantitation (LOQ) are 33.33 ng mL-1 and 13.03 ng mL-1, respectively.

However, the rigid application of this constraint can produce unrealistic solutions in practice due to the inadequacy of the analyzed data to the characteristics and requirements of the trilinear model. Different methods for the relaxation of the trilinear model data requirements have been proposed, like in the PARAFAC2 and in the direct non-trilinear decomposition (DNTD) methods. In this work, the trilinearity constraint of MCR-ALS is adapted to different data scenarios where the proﬁles of all or some of the components of the system are shifted (not equally synchronized) or even change their shape among different slices in one of their data modes. This adaptation is especially useful in gas and liquid chromatography (GC and LC) and in Flow Injection Analysis (FIA) with multivariate spectroscopic detection. In a ﬁrst data example, a synthetic LC-DAD dataset is built to investigate the possibilities of the proposed method to handle systematic changes (shifts) in the retention times of the elution proﬁles and the results are compared with those obtained using alternative methods like ATLD, PARAFAC, PARAFAC2 and DNTD. In a second data example, multiple wine samples were simultaneously analyzed by GC-MS where elution proﬁles presented large deviations (shifts) in their peak retention times, although they still preserve the same peak shape. Different modelling scenarios are tested and the results are also compared. Finally, in the third example, sample mixtures of acid compounds were analyzed by FIA under a pH gradient and monitored by UV spectroscopy and also examined by different chemometric methods using a different number of components. In this case, however, the departure of the trilinear model comes from the acid base speciation of the system depending on the pH more than from the shifting of the FIA diffusion proﬁles.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhang","given":"Xin"},{"family":"Tauler","given":"Romà"}],"citation-key":"zhang_flexibleimplementationtrilinearity_2022","container-title":"Molecules","container-title-short":"Molecules","DOI":"10.3390/molecules27072338","ISSN":"1420-3049","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,5]]},"language":"en","license":"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","page":"2338","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Flexible Implementation of the Trilinearity Constraint in Multivariate Curve Resolution Alternating Least Squares (MCR-ALS) of Chromatographic and Other Type of Data","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/7/2338","volume":"27"},{"id":"zhang_Machinelearningapplications_2023","abstract":"•\n              The sources of multi-source data of cash crops and the strategies for processing multi-source data are summarized.\n            \n            \n              •\n              This paper summarizes several machine learning algorithms commonly used to analyze multi-source data of cash crops.\n            \n            \n              •\n              This paper summarizes the application of machine learning combined with multi-source data in cash crops in recent years, and prospects the development of this field in the future.\n            \n          \n        , The quality and safety of edible crops are key links inseparable from human health and nutrition.

First, the validation samples contained seven flavonoids at five levels, helped to understand and interpret the features of the second-order calibration method based on the alternating trilinear decomposition (ATLD) algorithm.

In ATSA, the chromatographic peak information of both reference and test samples can be completely employed for time-shift alignment to determine segment boundaries and avoid loss of information.

Food authenticity attributes, including biological identity, geographical origin, agricultural production, and processing technology, are susceptible to food fraud. Metabolic markers and their corresponding authentication methods are considered as a promising choice for food authentication. However, few metabolic markers were available to develop robust analytical methods for food authentication in routine control. Untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is increasingly used to discover metabolic markers. This review summarizes the general workflow, recent applications, advantages, advances, limitations, and future needs of untargeted metabolomics by LC-MS for identifying metabolic markers in food authentication. In conclusion, untargeted metabolomics by LC-MS shows great efficiency to discover the metabolic markers for the authenticity assessment of biological identity, geographical origin, agricultural production, processing technology, freshness, cause of animals’ death, and so on, through three main steps, namely, data acquisition, biomarker discovery, and biomarker validation. The application prospects of the selected markers by untargeted metabolomics require to be valued, and the selected markers need to be eventually applicable at targeted analysis assessing the authenticity of unknown food samples.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2022",5,10]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhong","given":"Peng"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Xiaoqun"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiangmei"},{"family":"Wei","given":"Xiaoyi"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Shaozong"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Weijuan"},{"family":"Koidis","given":"Anastasios"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Zhenlin"},{"family":"Lei","given":"Hongtao"}],"citation-key":"zhong-UntargetedMetabolomicsLiquid-2021","container-title":"Comprehensive Reviews in Food Science and Food Safety","DOI":"10.1111/1541-4337.12938","ISSN":"1541-4337","issue":"n/a","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,19]]},"language":"en","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for food authentication: A review","title-short":"Untargeted metabolomics by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for food authentication","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1541-4337.12938","volume":"n/a"},{"id":"zhou_AntioxidantProfilingGinger_2021","abstract":"Reaction flow (RF) chromatography is a powerful and efficient approach that utilizes conventional high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-ultraviolet (UV)-visible detection. This technique exploits a novel column end-fitting and an extra HPLC pump that delivers a reagent specific for selective detection, in particular the antioxidant profiling of natural products. This study employed RF for the first time to identify antioxidants in a commercial ginger sample. This demonstrated the previously validated assay's ease and power to extract information about the natural product's antioxidant properties. Due to the simplicity involved with data analysis and peak matching process, the following information was revealed between the chemical and antioxidant profiles: three of the strongest antioxidant activity peaks in the ginger sample (593nm) did not correlate with the three most abundant chemical profile peaks (UV absorbance at 254 and 280nm); the ratio of seven antioxidant peaks may be potentially used for food authenticity purposes, and future research should target these peaks for the early discovery of novel antioxidants sourced in ginger. Utilization of this previously validated assay provided the resolution of numerous peaks in the ginger extract and information associated with their antioxidant attributes and chemical abundance. This approach is more informative than total antioxidant assays that lack compound specificity information. Furthermore, it is superior to mass spectrometric (MS) assays that cannot evaluate each compound's antioxidant strength, and does not involve the expense involved in the acquisition and maintenance of the MS detection hardware, and does not require the high level of expertise needed to conduct the MS data analysis.","archive_location":"WOS:000695784700001","author":[{"family":"Zhou","given":"X"},{"family":"Power","given":"D"},{"family":"Jones","given":"A"},{"family":"Acquaviva","given":"A"},{"family":"Dennis","given":"GR"},{"family":"Shalliker","given":"RA"},{"family":"Li","given":"CG"},{"family":"Soliven","given":"A"}],"citation-key":"zhou_AntioxidantProfilingGinger_2021","container-title":"NATURAL PRODUCT COMMUNICATIONS","DOI":"10.1177/1934578X211035286","ISSN":"1934-578X","issue":"9","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",9]]},"language":"English","title":"Antioxidant Profiling of Ginger via Reaction Flow Chromatography","type":"article-journal","volume":"16"},{"id":"zhu_qualityassessmentmoringa_2020","abstract":"A fingerprint analysis method was established for the quality control of Moringa seed shells by high-performance liquid chromatography with diode array detection (HPLC–DAD).

The fingerprint of Moringa seed shells was established with good precision, reproducibility, and stability obtaining within 60 min, and 13 common peaks in the fingerprint were designed. Similarity analysis, principal component analysis (PCA), and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) were carried out to analyze the obtained fingerprints. The similarity among 11 batches of samples in addition to No. 5 and 6 was no less than 0.92. Eleven samples could be classified into 2 clusters. The HPLC fingerprint technology and application of chemical pattern recognition can provide a more comprehensive reference for the quality control of medicinal plants.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Yanqin"},{"family":"Du","given":"Ping"},{"family":"Huang","given":"Shaojun"},{"family":"Yin","given":"Qinhong"},{"family":"Yang","given":"Yaling"}],"citation-key":"zhu_qualityassessmentmoringa_2020","container-title":"Acta Chromatographica","container-title-short":"Acta Chromatographica","DOI":"10.1556/1326.2019.00545","ISSN":"2083-5736","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",3]]},"language":"en","page":"28-33","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Quality assessment of Moringa seed shells based on fingerprinting using HPLC-DAD","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://akjournals.com/view/journals/1326/32/1/article-p28.xml","volume":"32"},{"id":"zhu2014","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",9,1]]},"author":[{"family":"Zhu","given":"Shukui"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Wanfeng"},{"family":"Dai","given":"Wei"},{"family":"Tong","given":"Ting"},{"family":"Guo","given":"Pengfei"},{"family":"He","given":"Sheng"},{"family":"Chang","given":"Zhenyang"},{"family":"Gao","given":"Xuanbo"}],"citation-key":"zhu2014","container-title":"Analytical Methods","container-title-short":"Anal.

STEM specifically refers to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, but now has a broader meaning to include environment, economics, and medicine. Currently, there is not an agreement of the particulars in education, or in standards, by professional organizations that define STEM literacy. Most definitions do cover societal and economic needs but overlook personal needs. There is a general consensus that everyone needs to be STEM literate. But there is a difference between literacy and being literate. STEM literacy should not be viewed as a content area but as a deictic means (composed of skills, abilities, factual knowledge, procedures, concepts, and metacognitive capacities) to gain further learning. This paper gives a brief background of literacy definitions in STEM and presents a description of STEM literacy based upon (1) cognitive, (2) affective, and (3) psychomotor learning theory domains. The paper stresses the need to evolve from learning for STEM literacy to using STEM literacy for learning to satisfy our societal, economic, and personal needs.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Zollman","given":"Alan"}],"citation-key":"zollman2012","container-title":"School Science and Mathematics","DOI":"10.1111/j.1949-8594.2012.00101.x","ISSN":"1949-8594","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2012"]]},"language":"en","page":"12-19","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Learning for STEM Literacy: STEM Literacy for Learning","title-short":"Learning for STEM Literacy","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1949-8594.2012.00101.x","volume":"112"},{"id":"zotero-110","citation-key":"zotero-110","language":"en","page":"1","source":"Zotero","title":"COVID-19 digital certificate","type":"article-journal"},{"id":"zotero-179","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2021",10,25]]},"citation-key":"zotero-179","title":"Increasing the Number of Analyzable Peaks in Comprehensive Two-Dimensional Separations through Chemometrics | Analytical Chemistry","type":"webpage","URL":"https://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/ac0010025"},{"id":"zotero-194","abstract":"Elsevier’s Scopus, the largest abstract and citation database of peer-reviewed literature.

The study of wine composition by metabolomic tools, referred as Wineomics, has emerged as a revolutionary approach to unravel the chemical space of wines and to associate wine composition with important viticultural and enological traits including grape variety, geographical origin, terroir or typicity. \nOne of the most promising applications of metabolomic tools for wine analysis is the study of wine traceability and authenticity, a major issue for the wine industry and consumers. These studies are extremely complex, because counterfeits are becoming more sophisticated and they require powerful techniques capable to detect subtle differences between wines.

Before seeds are sown, effective screening of high-quality seeds for planting is crucial to improve the quality of crop yield, and seed vitality is one of the important indicators to evaluate seed quality, which can represent the potential ability of seeds to germinate quickly and whole and grow into normal seedlings or plants. Meanwhile, the advantage of nondestructive testing technology is that the seeds themselves will not be damaged. In this study, hyperspectral technology and superoxide dismutase activity were used to detect peanut seed vigor. To investigate peanut seed vigor and predict superoxide dismutase activity, spectral characteristics of peanut seeds in the wavelength range of 400-1000 nm were analyzed. The spectral data are processed by a variety of hot spot algorithms. Spectral data were preprocessed with Savitzky-Golay (SG), multivariate scatter correction (MSC), and median filtering (MF), which can effectively to reduce the effects of baseline drift and tilt. CatBoost and Gradient Boosted Decision Tree were used for feature band extraction, the top five weights of the characteristic bands of peanut seed vigor classification are 425.48nm, 930.8nm, 965.32nm, 984.0nm, and 994.7nm. XGBoost, LightGBM, Support Vector Machine and Random Forest were used for modeling of seed vitality classification. XGBoost and partial least squares regression were used to establish superoxide dismutase activity value regression model. The results indicated that MF-CatBoost-LightGBM was the best model for peanut seed vigor classification, and the accuracy result was 90.83%. MSC-CatBoost-PLSR was the optimal regression model of superoxide dismutase activity value. The results show that the R\n              2\n              was 0.9787 and the RMSE value was 0.0566. The results suggested that hyperspectral technology could correlate the external manifestation of effective peanut seed vigor.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2023",9,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Zou","given":"Zhiyong"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Jie"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Weijia"},{"family":"Luo","given":"Jinghao"},{"family":"Long","given":"Tao"},{"family":"Wu","given":"Qingsong"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Qianlong"},{"family":"Zhen","given":"Jiangbo"},{"family":"Zhao","given":"Yongpeng"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yuchao"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Yongming"},{"family":"Zhou","given":"Man"},{"family":"Xu","given":"Lijia"}],"citation-key":"zou_2023","container-title":"Frontiers in Plant Science","container-title-short":"Front.
