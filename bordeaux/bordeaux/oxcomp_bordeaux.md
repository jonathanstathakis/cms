# Oxford Companion to Wine - Bordeaux

```toc
minLevel:2
```

## History

- Clairet is produced by fermenting red and white grapes together
- Médocain is a term for someone belonging to Médoc.
- appellation contrôlée was established in 1936.
- château bottling become compulsory for classed growths in 1972. This is indicated on the label as *mise en bouteille au château*.

## Geography

- Bordeaux vineyards are notably flat, generally at sea level.
- Haut-Médoc is relatively higher than the surrounding area.
- Haut-Médoc consists of (south to north) Margaux, St-Julien, Pauillac, St-Estèphe, and then Listrac and Moulis inland of these.
- Pessac-Léognan is an enclave of Graves which received its own appellation in 1987.
- The satellite appellations of Pomerol and St-Émilion are Lalande-de-Pomerol, Montagne-St-Émilion, Lussac-St-Émilion, St-Georges-St-Émilion and Puisseguin-St-Émilion
- west of Pomerol is Fronsac and Canon-Fronsac.
- Côtes de Bordeaux is a group term for the regions of Bourg and Blaye
- Sainte-Foy Bordeaux in Graves produces red and white wine.

## Climate (p.556)

- Climate is generally temperate
- The Gulf Stream warms the air and its influence is experienced far inland due to the wide Gironde Estuary.
- Maritime climate protects vines from winter freeze and spring frost, although instances have occurred, for example freeze 1956 and frost in 1991.
- spring is mild and damp.
- cabernet sauvignon may struggle to ripen fully.
- flowering is a time of risk as cold rain and strong winds may disturb pollination resulting in reduced crop yields through [[coulure]] and [[millerandage]].
- hot summers
- The forests of the Landes to the south moderate temperatures and protect from strong oceanic winds (how? Ocean is to the west..)
- summer is starting to get hot enough for vines to suffer water stress.
- rain is a hazard at harvest.
- humidity in autumn is desired to produce noble rot
- botrytis is fostered in autumn morning mist.
- the Ciron is shaded by the Landes forest until it converges with the Garonne. Consequently it is much cooler than the Garonne, encouraging mist to form at the point of convergence. This has resulted in a tight clustering of high-quality sweet wine producers in that area.
- botrytis is enocuraged by morning mist is followed by a warm dry afternoon. If too damp, grey rot forms instead.

## Vine Varieties (p. 558)

- Sémillon was the most planted vine in the 1970's but has very much waned in importance since then.
- Sauvignon blanc was typically used to bolster Sémillon whites as a subordinate but is currently rising as a single varietal wine and is almost as widely planted as Sémillon.
- caberent sauvignon is at risk of not ripening if summer is not hot or sunny enough.
- *encépagement* refers to the proportions of varietals in a wine blend.
- typical *encépagements*:
	- Médoc: 70% CS, 20% Merlot, 10% CF.
	- St-Émilion: 70% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc.
	- sweet wines: 80% Sémillon, 20% Sauvignon Blanc
- whites are starting to be produced in Médoc following the lead of Pavillon Blanc de Ch. Margaux.

## Viticulture (pp. 560)

- guyot-trained, low-vigour vines.
- vine density: 10,000 vines per ha in Médoc, less premium producers 5,000 - 6000 vines per ha.
- common diseases:
	- eutypa dieback
	- botyrytis
- yields are increased by fertilizers including manure and pesticides.
- crop thinning and leaf plucking has been used since the late 1980's (to manage humidity and vigour?) - does raise risk of sunburn.
- density can be too high for mechanical harvesting.
- traditionally harvest begins 100 days after harvesting, these days tending to leave the fruit on longer to achieve full phenolic ripeness.
- sweet white wines in Sauternes may be picked as late as november.
- chx Mouton Rothschild and Pétrus have been known to use helicopters to move cold air around to manage spring frosts

## Winemaking (pp. 562 - 563)

### Red Wines

- terminology:
	- wine is fermented in a vat hall or *cuvier*
	- élevage occurs in rooms called *chai*, typically 1 year of elevation per *chai*. Equivalent to a cellar, barrel hall or *cave*.
	- fermentation vessels are referred to as *cuves*.
- grapes are destemmed before crush
- fermentation can occur in cement, stainless steel, or wood.
- fermentation runs from 5 to 10 days.
- temperature control is common but only required in hotter vintages.
- winemakers are increasingly warming vessels prior to beginning fermentation.
- fermentation occurs at around a maximum 30oC, slightly hotter than typical new world equivalents.
- pumping over (*pigeage*) several times a day is common, but must be done with care when working with phenolically rich grapes such as those from CS.
- post-fermenation maceration is seen as important and can last at least a week or more.
- chaptalization is common and accepted in Bordeaux however wineries have beenexperimenting with concentration via osmosis and reverse osmosis since the 1990's.
- relying on ambient yeast is universal as grapes have been an important crop in Bordeaux for millennia.
- after fermentation free-run wine is racked off solids either by pumping or gravity fed plumbing. the more that is run off the less pressing is required.
- wine is then racked into oak barrels
- Bordeaux tends to use oak from Limousin.
- In Bordeaux they use a barrel format called a *barrique*.
- The use of new oak is relatively recent and tends to be less than 60%, less so in cooler vintages.
- in the first year of élevage wine is racked every three months followed by fining with egg-white.
- in the second year the wine is moved to a different. chai until it is blended prior to bottling, typically in the early summer.
- bottles tend to be sold rather than aged in chateaux.
- *assemblage* is the process of final blending to produce the *grand vin*, the second wines and the remainder.
- microoxygenation is becoming more popular and is employed to artificially mature samples for the *en primeur* tasting.
- basic Bordeaux AOC wines will be filtered rather than fined and not see any barrel maturation, rather spend time in steel tank before bottling.
- the following appellations are exclusive to red wines: Médoc, Haut-Médoc, St-Estéphe, Pauillac, St-Julien, Margaux, Listrac, Moulis, St-Émilion, Pomerol, Fronsac and some of Côtes de Bordeaux.

### Dry Whites (pp. 566)

 
- The dry white appellations of Bordeaux are: Pessac-Léognan, Graves, Entre-Deux-Mers, Blaye and Bordeaux AOC.
- white winemaking in Bordeaux is unremarkable.

### Sweet Whites (pp. 567)

- Sweet white wine appellations: Sauternes, Barsac, Sainte-Croix-du-Mont, Loupiac, Cérons, Cadillac, Premières Côtes de Bordeaux, Graves Supérieures, Ste-Foy-Bordeaux, Côtes de Bordeaux-Saint-Macaire, Bordeaux Supérieur
- *moelleux* is a sweet wine simply made by stopping fermentation once a desired level of residual sugar is reached. It is falling in popularity. A simple dessert wine. It is made by either chilling, sulfur dioxide addition, or sterile filtration.
- botrytised wines are a level of richness above *moelleux* and can be referred to as *liquoreux*, meaning syrupy sweet.

## Bordeaux AOC (pp. 567 - 568)

- red, white, sweet whites, rosé, clairet and sparkling.
- mostly made by co-operatives and sold for blending into generic wines.
- 90% is red, 10% white.
- sweet white wines may be labelled Bordeaux Moelleux
- Bordeaux Supérieur, or Bord Sup. represents a more intense style and requires a maximum yield of 56 hl/ha as opposed to 60hl/ha for the base level, and 10 months maturation before release.
- approximately 25% of Bordeaux AOC red is made as Bordeaux Superieur
- few producers use oak.
- a notable wine under Bordeaux AOC is Mouton Cadet, made from a blend of regionally sourced fruit.

## Bordeaux Trade (pp. 570)

- there were 89 *coutier* businesses in 2014.
- Traditionally the chateaux would produce the raw fermentation product which was acquired by *négociants* who would mature it in their *chai*.
- Generally the *négocient* would have more technical know-how (cellarmaster and team)
- these days the *négocient* is focused more on dealings between the principal and the broker, and focused on wine storage/maturation and selling direct to customer.
- Prominent *négocients* include: Barton, Cruse, Sichel, Moueix.

## En Primeur (pp. 1340)

- wine sold as futures BEFORE bottling.
- typically classed growths.
- cask samples are shown in spring following the vintage.
- sales are performed through brokers followed by négociants.
- chateaux tend to release only a proportion of its production (a tranche) *en primeur* depending on its need for immediate funding and potential profit.
- the purchaser pays in the first spring but waits up to 2 years for the finished product.
- advantage to the purchaser is that the wine is potentially more affordable and ensures they have access to the most highly desired wines.
- advantages of *en primeur* assume a rising market - in times of downturn the product may be lower valued at the time of recievement.
- purchaser takes a risk that the sample tasted is a true predictor of future character - not guaranteed by any means.

## Négociant (pp. 2382)

- french term for a merchant.
- generally speaking a négocient will purchase the raw or semi-processed ingredients of a wine, for example the fruit, must or raw ferment and bottle it under their own label.
- Famous for making *perfect* blends from variously sourced wines.
