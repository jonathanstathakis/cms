## Map of Bordeaux

![[map_of_bordeaux.png|400]]

## Bordeaux

- Bordeaux is Frances largest AOP/AOC region.
- Bordeaux produces white, rose, sweet and sparkling wines.

### History

- Wine production near the Garonne from at least 4th century AD.
- Dutch drained the Estuary marshes in the mid 1600's, making it suitable for agriculture.
- After the draining, the *noblesse de la robe* established the châteaux known today.
- Bordeaux wine market benefited from the region's importance as a centre of trade due to its proximity to the Atlantic.

### Trade Model

- The *négociant* arose in the 18th century as part of a merchant class with the resource to store and sell wine on a commercial scale.
- Négociants buy fruit or wine in barrel to age in their own cellars before selling the bottled product.
- *Courtiers* were wine brokers who would provide châteaux with financial backing in exchange for control of the trade of the wine.
- Post WW2 négociant production is less prominent than châteaux but courtiers still control the trade of Bordaux wine, most evident in their *en primeur* selling of Bordeaux wine as futures.

### Chateaux Model

- A châteaux produces one *grand vin*. The fruit for this wine is sourced from one appellation, however they can be from disconnected parcels.
- Some châteaux produce a red and white wine.
- Some châteaux produce less expensive *second wine* made from fruit deemed inferior for the grand vin.

## Climate

- the climate is maritime.
- Atlantic ocean and Gironde act as moderating influences.
- Moderating influences protect vines from winter freeze, spring frost.
- Winters are short
- springtime damp
- summer can reach high temperatures.
- Coastal pine forest protects Médoc vineyards from harsh west and northwesterly winds.
- Rain is a concern, especially at harvest.
- Climate becomes more continental toward St-Émilion and Pomerol.
- Wet Spring and general humidity amplify mold and rot.
- Autumn humidity is good for botrytis, a positive in sweet wine producing Graves in the west.
- If too cool, autumn humidity can also produce grey rot, which destroys fruit.
- springtime frost produce *coulure* and *millerandage* which reduces yield.
- *bordeaux mixture* = lime, copper sulfate, water is used to prevent fungal infection^[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux_mixture].
- Climate more consistent than more northerly French regions but still produce wide vintage variation.

## The Grapes and Appellation System of Bordeaux

### Bordeaux AOP

- red, white, rosé or clairet styles of wine
- they are the lowest rung of the Bordeaux quality system.
- they can be produced throughout entire Bordeaux region.

### Blending

- is important as different grapes ripen at different speeds to due varying climate, soil profiles and the cultivars natural tendencies.
- similar to a diverse stock portfolio, growing a mixture of varieties, called an *encépagement*, which flower and ripen at different times and rates respectively, provides an estate with security in the face of an annually varying climate. For example CS buds later than Merlot who is vulnerable to late spring frost, however its fruit ripens slower than Merlot who is already picked by the time heavy autumn rain arrives which can dilute the CS fruit.

#### Reds

- Red Bordeaux fruit is complementary. Blending them adds complexity.
- fruit contribution to red blends:
	- Cabernet provides tannin, pigment, power, lngevity.
	- Merlot provides fleshy, juicy texture to soften CS
	- CF more tannic than Merlot less muscular and weighty than CS gives herbal spice and red fruit aromatics
- location:
	- blend proportion depends on location as fruit varies according to climate and soil.
	- Left Bank blends are CS 2/3:1/3 M, CF, others.
	- Right Bank M and CF dominant, typically 3/4:1/4
	- proportions are commune/chateaux dependent.
- Contribution of the Minor Varieties:
	- Petit Verdot sometimes added to Left Bank blends to add color, depth and exotic perfume, not used on the right.
	- Malbec is used is used to soften Right Bank blends, analogous to Merlot in the Left Bank, but it is infrequently encounted.

### AOP Reds

- 6 grapes:
	- Cabernet Sauvignon
	- Merlot
	- Cabernet Franc
	- Petit Verdot
	- Malbec
	- Carmènere

#### Merlot

- most variety in Bordeaux
- ripens earliest (of the AOP varieties)
- performs best in clay-based soils as they diminish the vines natural vigor.

#### Cabernet Sauvignon

- performs best in well-drained gravel - roots can run deep, water stress increases fruit concentration.
- struggles to ripen in colder limestone and clay soil.

#### Cabernet Franc

- performs best in limestone-based soils - limestone promotes acidity and freshness in wine.

### AOP White Blends

- Major varieties: Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscadelle
- Minor: Sauvignon Gris
- Restricted to 30%: Ugni Blanc, Merlot Blanc, Colombard
- Sauvignon Blanc provides pungency, high acidity, and citrus flavors
- SB can be softened with Sémillon and rounded with oak.
- Best whites (regardless of dry or off-dry) are creamy, waxy with aromas of honey and beeswax.
- Muscadelle is used sparely as its floral aromatics can dominate the blend.

### Use of Oak in AOP Wines

- Bordeaux grapes have a natural affinity for oak.
- AOP restricts the length of time wine can be rested in large format old oak.
- top chateaux often mature their red wine in barriques for up to 2 years, using a high proportion of new oak.
- top-tier Graves estates will mature their whites in oak for up to 12 to 16 mths with the quantity of new oak varying by producer.

### Bordeaux Supérieur AOP

- red and off-dry whites with higher minimum alcohol level qualify for this designation.

### Crémant De Bordeaux AOP

- traditional method sparkling wines produced in Bordeaux are classified under this moniker.

## The Left Bank: Médoc

### Médoc AOP

- contains the left bank of the Gironde Estuary, running 80 km north of Bordeaux city.
- Haut-Médoc AOP and communal appellations rest inside of it.
- used as a catch-all appellation for chateaux who don't meet more specific requirements, generally in the Bas-Médoc (js - this article appears to use Medoc AOP as a synonym for these wines.)
- generally peak after 5 years of age but lack longevity and concentration compared to their southern counterparts.
- Use a relatively high proportion of Merlot as it performs more reliably (compared to..) in the waterlogged, clay-heavy soils of the Bas-Medoc
- Good value for money in warmer vintages
- simple fruit and earth flavours.
- generally no oak influence - inexpensive wine.
- produced by chateaux and co-operatives.

### Haut-Médoc AOP

- lies on a narrow corridor on the left bank of the Gironde in Southern Médoc.
- best vineyards have well-drained gravelly soils ideal for CS
- the better chateaux tend to be located on deep banks of gravel mounds called *croupes*, unveiled after the dutch drained the swamps, primarily Saint-Estèphe, Pauillac, St. Julien, Listrac-Médoc, Moulis-en-Médoc, and Margaux.
- Contains a large number of the best producing CS chateaux in bordeaux.

### 1855 Classification of Bordeaux

- Commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III for the Universal Exposition.
- performed by Bordelais courtiers
- ranked the chateaux of Bordeaux by price from first to fifth growth.
- All red wine members were from Médoc except for Château Haut-Brion.
- defined upon the property name rather than the land (in contrast to Burgundy) thus classification/declassification rests on who owns the property.
- it is controversial system. It is argued that if the chateaux produces wine not in line with the quality of the area then it will fail to be profitable and sell to someone who can do better, however critics state that this has not occurred and that the designation does not accurately reflect the quality of the wine.
- The system has proved resilant due to politics and its historical significance.
- The only change to the classification occurred in 1973 when Château Muton-Rothschild was elevated from second growth to first.

### Other Designations

#### Cru Artisan

- has been in use for nearly 150 years but only formally recognised in 2002
- used by 36 small producers
- Producers are recognised for their contribution to the land, the craft of winemaking in spite of their lack of financial backing and facilities of larger operations.
- work an average of 6 hectares each.
- originally 44 producers in 2005 but after a review in 2018 was reduced to 39 to reflect changes in ownership.
- Reviewed every 5 years, used to be reviewed every 10.

#### Cru Bourgeois

- originally introduced in 1932 and divided 444 properties into 3 categories: *Cru Bourgeois Exceptional*, *Cru Bourgeois Supérieur*, and *Cru Bourgeois*.
- Made official in 2003 but 197 chateaux were eliminated, leaving 247, and in the legal storm that followed the classification was nullified entirely.
- re-introduced in 2008 but with only *Cru Bourgeois*.
- in 2018 the other two designations were re-introduced.
- in 2020 249 chateaux were awareded *Cru Bourgeois* status with 14 *crus bourgeois exceptionnel* and 56 *crus bourgeois supérieurs*
- reviewed every 5 years.
- next review is in 2025.

#### Margaux AOP

- largest communal appellation
- 4 villages: Soussans, margaux-Cantenac, Labarde, and Arsac.

- margaux second growths are seen as underperformers.
- notable chateau: Château Palmer - excellent and expensive.
	- margaux wines tend to be floral with exotic character and finesse.

### Médoc

- *jalles* are drainage channels that criss-cross the area that stop the area reverting to swampland.

- 13 cru classé reds and 9 whites.
- Chateau La Tour Haut-Brion produced its last vintage in 2005 and Chateau Laville Haut-Brion produced its last vintage in 2008, they now work together to produce wine for a label Chateau La Mission Haut-Brion. so now 15 chateaux.

### Graves Supérieur AOP

- contains three sweet wine appellations:

			- grapes are harvested with a minimum must weight of 221 grams per liter
			- finished wines need 45 grams per liter of residual sugar.
		- the wines are often matured in moderate - to - high prop of new oak for up to 2 years.

### Notable Chateaux

- Haut-Brion is a first growth.

### Botrytis

- unique climatic conditions in Sauternes and Barsac (less so in Cérons) enable Botrytis to pierce grape skins enabling dehydration that concentrates sugar, acidity and glycerol content. Results in spice complexity - honey, saffron, dried fruit, ginger.
- Sautuernes favours Botrytis because it sits at the conflux of Ciron and Garonne rivers and the interaction between the cool Ciron and warmer Garonne produces lots of cool morning mist in better vintages. This results in afternoon humidity especially in Autumn when the fruit is ripened.
- Botrytis does not attack fruit evenly thus grape growers need to pick individually over several runs in order to produce an adequate crop of fully botrytised fruit.
- the labor involved makes this work very expensive.

### Sauternes

- produces some of the most expensive dessert wines in the world
- produced from Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle
- highly complex in good vintages due to noble rot, otherwise known as *pourriture noble* technical term *Botrytis cinerea*.

#### Classifications

- SautErnes was classified during the 1855 classification
- obtained first and second growths
- Chateau d'Yquem got Permier Cru Supérieur.

#### Notable Producer of Sauturnes

- Chateau d'Yquem.
	- does not produce a Sauternes AOP in poor years. Examples are 1992 and 1974.
	- Sometimes produces a dry white called "Y" for "Ygrec" labelled as Bordeaux (?)
- Chateau Gilette is an unclassified chateaux that produces the Créme de Tête, notable for maturing after decades in concrete vats.

#### Barsac

- Wines of Barsac can be sold as Sauturnes AOP or Barsac AOP.

## The Right Bank
