# Pessac-Léognan AOC

As the city of Bordeaux expanded in the first half of the 20th century, the commercial value of wine production from vineyards in northern Graves was surpassed by their real estate value. The response was to create the Pessac-Léognan AOC [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert, sec. Pessac-Léognan AOP].

80% red, CS and Merlot equally important, blends vary across producers. Whites blend of SB and Sémillon or pure SB.

Notable producers include first growth Château Haut-Brion and Domaine de Chevalier.
