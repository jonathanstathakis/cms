## Syllabus

### Introductory

#### Factors Affecting Climate

- maritime climate due to influence from the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean. Its influence is carried through inland by the wide Gironde Estuary [@oxcomp_bordeaux, p. 556], moderating extremes, protecting from winter freeze, spring frost [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
- coastal pine forests protect left bank from harsh west/northwesterly winds[@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
- [[Landes forest]] in the south also moderates temperatures nad protects from strong oceanic winds [@oxcomp_bordeaux, p. 556].
- more continental climate in St-Émilion and Pomerol [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
- mild, damp spring.
- warm to hot summers
- humid autumns
- in Sauternes the Ciron converges with the Garonne

#### Soil Types

- left bank:
	- bas-medoc
		- clay heavy [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
	- haut-medoc
		- well-draining gravelly soil [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
		- best chateaux on gravel mounds called *croupes* [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
		- note: Margaux has a diverse range of soils relative to the other sub-regions of the Haut-Medoc [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
	- Graves
		- similar to Médoc but more sand [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
- right bank
	- St-Emilion
		- 2 soil types, *côtes* and *graves*.
			- *côtes*: steep limestone hillsides [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
			- *graves*: gravelly limestone plateaus [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
	- Pomerol
		- sand, gravel and topsoil of iron pan and rich class called *crasse de fer* [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
		- note: Petrus is distinct for its subsoil clays very close to the surface [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
	- Boug and Cotes de Bourg
		- limestone soil [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]

#### Production and Aging Techniques (Barrique Fermentation/Ageing)

- sorting:  
		- fruit sorted by quality to isolate the densest, best fruit for a *grand vin*. Sorting is done optically (fruit appearance) and mechanically via a density sorter (float fruit in a water bath, fruit that sinks is dense enough for a *grand vin*) [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- fruit preparation
	- destemming is common [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- preprocessing
	- chaptalization is permissible [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- water content removal by vacuum distillation or reverse osmosis can be seen in wetter and cooler vintages [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- fermentation
	- vessel:
		- red:
			- all kinds of vessels used: large wood casks, stainless steel tank, buried expoxy-lined concrete vat, naked cement vat[@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- white:
			- dry and sweet typically fermented in barrique [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- estates may blend different vessel batches together to create a style [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- cap management:
		- *remontage* (pump over) is traditional [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
		- *pigeage* is sometimes used but run the risk of over-extraction in varieties like CS [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- MLF:
		- reds:
			- MLF used for reds generally 3 months after harvest [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- whites:
			- no MLF unless overly acidic [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- micro-oxygenation:
		- used to soften green, rustic and tannic edges [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
- élevage
	- formats
		- variety of formats used - oak barrique, concrete, steel [@wset_bordeaux]
		- red *grand vin*: 18 - 24 months, typically in 100% new oak in a range of cooperage styles [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- white: 12 - 15 months in barrel, 50% new oak [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- [[racking]]:
		- maximum of once every three months. [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- [[cliquage]] may be used [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- assemblage
	- two schools of thought:
		1. performed early in the year after harvest prior to [[en primeur]] in April so the foundation of the finished wine can be judged[@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		2. after [[en primeur]] just before bottling to enable each component to mature individually for as long as possible [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- occurs 6 months after harvest [@wset_bordeaux]
- clarification and stabilisation
	- finding and filtration common, either one or the other or both, or neither. [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
- bottling
	- bottling done end of April after harvest [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
	- closure:
		- Cork is used universally [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].

#### Botrytis Wine Production

Botrytis wine is sweet white wine whose fruit has been infected by Botrytis cinerea, or noble rot. The mould pierces the skin of the fruit resulting in dehydration that concentrates acidity, sugars and glycerol, adding honey, saffron, ginger, dried fruit and iodine characters. The result is a viscous, golden, textural and aromatic wines. It is produced in the communes belonging to Sauternes AOP: Sauternes, Bommes, Preignac, and Barsac, records indicating that the style was conceived in the 18th century [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]. The best vineyards are located at the confluence of Ciron and Garonne where cool morning mists and humidity are generated that benefit noble rot infection [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].

The *assemblage* consists of Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, and Muscadelle, with sémillon as the dominant varietal because its thinner skin is more prone to infection. Cordon training is preferred as it results in smaller berries which are better for As botrytis does not affect grapes evenly, during picking several passes (*tries*) are required to produce a consistent crop, generally 3 - 4 passes are required. This is mandated by AOP law. If a vintage does not produce quality fruit OR botrytis infection then the wine will not be made [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]..  
Chaptalization and cryo-extraction are permitted. Barrel fermentation is common, often in new oak barrique followed by élevage in the same vessel. Sulfur dixoide is used liberally to prevent development of volatile acidity and secondary fermentation. The final product can reach 14% alcohol with a residual sugar range of 120 - 160 g/L [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].

> [!Important Points]
> - botrytis wines are sweet whites influenced by infection with Botryis cinerea
> - resulting dehydration concentrates acidity, sugars and glycerol and adds honey, saffron, ginger, dried fruit and iodine character with alcohol up to 14% and RS between 120g - 160g/L.
> - it is produced in Sauternes AOP which consists of the communes of Sauternes, Barsac, Bommes, and Preignac
> - Best vineyards are located at the confluence of the Ciron and Garonne where the generated morning mists and humidity are optimal for Botrytis.
> - *assemblage* (in order of proportion): Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscadelle.
> - Sémillon favors production of Botrytis wines because its relatively thinner skin enhances the effects of the mould.
> - Cordon training is preferred as it results in smaller berries: more surface area of rot per hectare
> - Botrytis does not infect evenly so several passes are required to obtain a consistent crop.
> - as dependence on rot progression introduces another varietal variable, it is unusually common for harvests of potential Botrytis wine to be rejected.
> - Chaptalization and cryo-extraction are permitted
> - Premium producers will ferment in new oak barriques followed by élevage in the same vessel
> - sulfur dioxide is used librerally to minimise volatile acidity and secondary fermentation.

#### Districts, Subdistricts and Location

The Bordeaux winegrowing region can be divided into the Left Bank and Right Bank of the Gironde Estuary, with the Left Bank further divided into the localities of Médoc, Graves and Sauternes, and the Right Bank into Pomerol and St Émilion in the west, centered around Libourne. Between these two divisions and the rivers of Dordogne and Garonne lies the Entre-Deux-Mers [@johnson_worldatlaswine_2019, pp. 84].

#### Classification System 1855

An immutable classification of the best chateaux (most expensive) in Bordeaux in 1855, commissioned by Emperor Napoleon III for the Universal Exposition and carried out by Bordelais courtiers. Included red and sweet white wine producers, with 5 ranks or growths for red and 3 ranks for white. Red: First Growths (*premiers Crus*), Second Growths (*Deuxièmes Crus*), Third Growths (*Troisèmes Crus*), Fourth Growths (*Quatrièmes Crus*), Fifth Growths (*Cinquièmes Crus*), white: Superior First Growth (*Premier Cru Supérieur*), First Growth (*Premier Cru*), Second Growths (*Deuxième Crus*) [@wiki_class1855]. The red first growths are Chateaux Lafite, Latour, Mouton Rothschild, Margaux, and Haut-Brion. While it is regarded as immutable, there have been some changes, for example Mouton-Rothschild was elevated from second to first growth in 1973. It is a controversial classification because it favours long-established, wealthy, jealous and generally conservative chateaux [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024, @guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].

##### First Growths

- Montrose (seocnd, St-Éstephe) [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
- Lafite (Pauillac)
- Mouton-Rothschild (Pauillac)
- Léoville Las Cases (second growth, St-Julien) [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]

- Latour (Margaux)
- Margaux (Margaux)
- Palmer (third growth, Margaux) [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]

#### St Emillion Classification

The St-Émilion Classification was first drafted in 1955. and reviewed every 10 years or so, with the last review in 2022. After much discord, its current format possesses 3 tiers and includes 85 estates^[[vins-saint-emilion](https://vins-saint-emilion.com/en/welcome-in-the-vineyard/saint-emilion-wine-classification/)] - premier grand cru classé A (Pavie, Figeac), premier grand cru classé B (12 estates), grand cru classé (71 estates). To participate in the classification the wine must be sold within La Place de Bordeaux.

#### Grape Varietals

- black grapes: cabernet sauvignon merlot, cabernet franc, petit verdot, malbec, Carmenère [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
- white grapes: Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscadelle [@wset_bordeaux]

#### Blending - Importance of Varietal in the Blend

blending *assemblage* is important as vintages in Bordeaux vary and the variety that performs best one vintage may not perform so well in the next. Primarily a mix of early and late blooming / ripening varieties, i.e. Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, which protects from sporadic spring frost or rain at harvest guarantees a consistently quality and profitable harvest year on year. These varieties are also sensitive to soil types and since Bordeaux has a diverse range of soils, varieties with an affinity for one soil, say Merlot in clay, can carry the blend where say Cabernet Sauvignon is struggling to perform, and vice versa.

#### Styles of Wine from Principal Production Districts

- Left Bank
  - Médoc
	  - Cabernet Dominant reds, increasing amount of dry whites.
  - Graves
	  - dry Red and white wines, with the addition of sweet whites in the south.
  - Sauternes
	  - botrytised sweet white wines.
- Right Bank
	- Merlot dominant red wines exclusively.
- Entre-Deux-Mers
	- red and white wines.

#### Trade Structure - En Primeur, Negociants

##### Trade Structure

- historically, chateaux would produce the wine, négociants would sell the wine, and primarily in the Médoc courtiers would broker deals between chateaux and négociants. [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
- The interwoven business relationship between the chateaux, négocients and courtiers is referred to as 'la Place de Bordeaux' [@vinovest_enprimeur].

##### En Primeur

the sales of **yet to be released** wines (i.e. futures), typically classed growths [@oxcomp_bordeaux, pp. 1340] such as Chateau Petrus [@vinovest_enprimeur]. Historically it was a business deal between chateaux (through courtiers) and négociants to take advantage of good years and smoothing out cashflow. Interest expanded through wine media such as Robert Parker etc. in the 80's [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]

The current system is as follows: cask samples are shown to critics in the spring after harvest who score samples [@oxcomp_bordeaux, pp. 1340]. Based on the scores the chateaus (through their *courtiers* [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]) set a price of sale to négocients. The négocients then make en primeur available to their customers [@vinovest_enprimeur]. Futures are released in successively more expensive tranches until all are sold. The purchaser then waits up to 2 years for the purchased wine to be delivered [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].

> [!Important points]
> - *en primeur*, or 'in their prime' is the sale of wine futures by chateaux (typically classed growths) through courtiers to négocients, and in turn from négocients to distributors, retailers and consumers.
> - 6 months after harvest a sample of the wine is presented to a board of critics who supply a score. Based on the rating, chateaux will release a proportion of production, or *tranche* for purchase.
> - A series of tranches are released, each more expensive than the next until all allocated stock is purchased.
> - It can take up to 2 years for the purchaser to receive the promised product.

##### Negociants

>[!Important points]
>- historical:
>	- traditionally responsible for the sale of wine to consumers [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
>  	- They had the resources to store the wine and sell it piecemeal, while the chateaux needed to sell their harvest as soon as it was finished fermenting in order to fund next years production. [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
>  	- in terms of wine lifecycle, négocients provided storage over time in their *chai*[@oxcomp_bordeaux, pp. 570], so the wine could undergo élevage [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
>- current day négocients focused on negotiating business deals between principals and brokers, wine storage and maturation and sales direct to consumer [@oxcomp_bordeaux].
>- prominent négocients include Barton, Cruse, Sichel, and Moueix [@oxcomp_bordeaux].

Négociants are french wine merchants who purchased bulk quantities of raw ferment from chateaux, providing them with the financial support required to produce the next vintage. Traditionally they fulfilled the role of *assemblage* and *élevage* in a wines lifecycle, storing the wine in their *chai* or warehouses before selling the finished product direct to consumers[@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert, @guildsomm_bordeaux_2024, @oxcomp_bordeaux, pp. 570]. Contemporarily, négocients are more focused on negotiating business agreements between brokers and principals as well as direct sales to consumers. Prominent négocients include Barton, Cruse, Sichel and Moueix [@oxcomp_bordeaux].

#### Location of top Bordeaux Properties

#### Cru Bourgeois Classification

Introduced in 1932, it originally included 444 properties excluded from the 1855 classification, introduced to provide marketing during the Great Depression and included three tiers: *cru bourgeois exceptionnel*, *cru bourgeois supérieur*, and *cru bourgeois*. It was however banned in 2007 after a controversial reclassification. After much reorganisation it settled in 2020 with 249 châteaux, 14 *crus bourgeois exceptionnels*, 56 *crus bourgeois supérieurs*, to be reviewed every 5 years [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert, sec. "Other Classifications of the Médoc: Cru Bourgeois and Cru Artisan"].
