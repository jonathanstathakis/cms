## Notes

### Terroir

### Factors Affecting Climate

- maritime climate due to influence from the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean. Its influence is carried through inland by the wide Gironde Estuary [@oxcomp_bordeaux, p. 556], moderating extremes, protecting from winter freeze, spring frost [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
- coastal pine forests protect left bank from harsh west/northwesterly winds[@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
- [[Landes forest]] in the south also moderates temperatures nad protects from strong oceanic winds [@oxcomp_bordeaux, p. 556].
- more continental climate in St-Émilion and Pomerol [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
- mild, damp spring.
- warm to hot summers
- humid autumns
- in Sauternes the Ciron converges with the Garonne

### Soil Types

- left bank:
	- bas-medoc
		- clay heavy [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
	- haut-medoc
		- well-draining gravelly soil [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
		- best chateaux on gravel mounds called *croupes* [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
		- note: Margaux has a diverse range of soils relative to the other sub-regions of the Haut-Medoc [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
	- Graves
		- similar to Médoc but more sand [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
- right bank
	- St-Emilion
		- 2 soil types, *côtes* and *graves*.
			- *côtes*: steep limestone hillsides [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
			- *graves*: gravelly limestone plateaus [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
	- Pomerol
		- sand, gravel and topsoil of iron pan and rich class called *crasse de fer* [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
		- note: Petrus is distinct for its subsoil clays very close to the surface [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
	- Boug and Cotes de Bourg
		- limestone soil [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]

### Grape Varietals

- black grapes: cabernet sauvignon merlot, cabernet franc, petit verdot, malbec, Carmenère [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
- white grapes: Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscadelle [@wset_bordeaux]

### Blending - Importance of Varietal in the Blend

blending *assemblage* is important as vintages in Bordeaux vary and the variety that performs best one vintage may not perform so well in the next. Primarily a mix of early and late blooming / ripening varieties, i.e. Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, which protects from sporadic spring frost or rain at harvest guarantees a consistently quality and profitable harvest year on year. These varieties are also sensitive to soil types and since Bordeaux has a diverse range of soils, varieties with an affinity for one soil, say Merlot in clay, can carry the blend where say Cabernet Sauvignon is struggling to perform, and vice versa.

### Production and Aging Techniques (Barrique Fermentation/Ageing)

- sorting:  
		- fruit sorted by quality to isolate the densest, best fruit for a *grand vin*. Sorting is done optically (fruit appearance) and mechanically via a density sorter (float fruit in a water bath, fruit that sinks is dense enough for a *grand vin*) [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- fruit preparation
	- destemming is common [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- preprocessing
	- chaptalization is permissible [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- water content removal by vacuum distillation or reverse osmosis can be seen in wetter and cooler vintages [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- fermentation
	- vessel:
		- red:
			- all kinds of vessels used: large wood casks, stainless steel tank, buried expoxy-lined concrete vat, naked cement vat[@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- white:
			- dry and sweet typically fermented in barrique [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- estates may blend different vessel batches together to create a style [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- cap management:
		- *remontage* (pump over) is traditional [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
		- *pigeage* is sometimes used but run the risk of over-extraction in varieties like CS [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- MLF:
		- reds:
			- MLF used for reds generally 3 months after harvest [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- whites:
			- no MLF unless overly acidic [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- micro-oxygenation:
		- used to soften green, rustic and tannic edges [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
- élevage
	- formats
		- variety of formats used - oak barrique, concrete, steel [@wset_bordeaux]
		- red *grand vin*: 18 - 24 months, typically in 100% new oak in a range of cooperage styles [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- white: 12 - 15 months in barrel, 50% new oak [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- [[racking]]:
		- maximum of once every three months. [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- [[cliquage]] may be used [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- assemblage
	- two schools of thought:
		1. performed early in the year after harvest prior to [[en primeur]] in April so the foundation of the finished wine can be judged[@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		2. after [[en primeur]] just before bottling to enable each component to mature individually for as long as possible [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- occurs 6 months after harvest [@wset_bordeaux]
- clarification and stabilisation
	- finding and filtration common, either one or the other or both, or neither. [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
- bottling
	- bottling done end of April after harvest [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
	- closure:
		- Cork is used universally [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].

### Botrytis Wine Production

> [!Important Points]
> - botrytis wines are sweet whites influenced by infection with Botryis cinerea
> - resulting dehydration concentrates acidity, sugars and glycerol and adds honey, saffron, ginger, dried fruit and iodine character with alcohol up to 14% and RS between 120g - 160g/L.
> - it is produced in Sauternes AOP which consists of the communes of Sauternes, Barsac, Bommes, and Preignac
> - Best vineyards are located at the confluence of the Ciron and Garonne where the generated morning mists and humidity are optimal for Botrytis.
> - *assemblage* (in order of proportion): Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscadelle.
> - Sémillon favors production of Botrytis wines because its relatively thinner skin enhances the effects of the mould.
> - Cordon training is preferred as it results in smaller berries: more surface area of rot per hectare
> - Botrytis does not infect evenly so several passes are required to obtain a consistent crop.
> - as dependence on rot progression introduces another varietal variable, it is unusually common for harvests of potential Botrytis wine to be rejected.
> - Chaptalization and cryo-extraction are permitted
> - Premium producers will ferment in new oak barriques followed by élevage in the same vessel
> - sulfur dioxide is used librerally to minimise volatile acidity and secondary fermentation.

#### Summary

Botrytis wine is sweet white wine whose fruit has been infected by Botrytis cinerea, or noble rot. The mould pierces the skin of the fruit resulting in dehydration that concentrates acidity, sugars and glycerol, adding honey, saffron, ginger, dried fruit and iodine characters. The result is a viscous, golden, textural and aromatic wines. It is produced in the communes belonging to Sauternes AOP: Sauternes, Bommes, Preignac, and Barsac, records indicating that the style was conceived in the 18th century [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]. The best vineyards are located at the confluence of Ciron and Garonne where cool morning mists and humidity are generated that benefit noble rot infection [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].

The *assemblage* consists of Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, and Muscadelle, with sémillon as the dominant varietal because its thinner skin is more prone to infection. Cordon training is preferred as it results in smaller berries which are better for As botrytis does not affect grapes evenly, during picking several passes (*tries*) are required to produce a consistent crop, generally 3 - 4 passes are required. This is mandated by AOP law. If a vintage does not produce quality fruit OR botrytis infection then the wine will not be made [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]..  
Chaptalization and cryo-extraction are permitted. Barrel fermentation is common, often in new oak barrique followed by élevage in the same vessel. Sulfur dixoide is used liberally to prevent development of volatile acidity and secondary fermentation. The final product can reach 14% alcohol with a residual sugar range of 120 - 160 g/L [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].

### Business

### Trade Structure - En Primeur, Negociants

#### Trade Structure

- historically, chateaux would produce the wine, négociants would sell the wine, and primarily in the Médoc courtiers would broker deals between chateaux and négociants. [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]

#### En Primeur

#### Negociants

### Localities

### St Emillion Classification

### Cru Bourgeois Classification

Introduced in 1932, it originally included 444 properties excluded from the 1855 classification, introduced to provide marketing during the Great Depression and included three tiers: *cru bourgeois exceptionnel*, *cru bourgeois supérieur*, and *cru bourgeois*. It was however banned in 2007 after a controversial reclassification. After much reorganisation it settled in 2020 with 249 châteaux, 14 *crus bourgeois exceptionnels*, 56 *crus bourgeois supérieurs*, to be reviewed every 5 years [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert, sec. "Other Classifications of the Médoc: Cru Bourgeois and Cru Artisan"].

### Chateaux
