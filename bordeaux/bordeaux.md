## Development Notes

### README

For this topic we will use the following resources:

## Terroir

### 1. Factors Affecting Climate

- maritime climate due to influence from the Gulf Stream in the Atlantic Ocean. Its influence is carried through inland by the wide Gironde Estuary [@oxcomp_bordeaux, p. 556], moderating extremes, protecting from winter freeze, spring frost [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
- coastal pine forests protect left bank from harsh west/northwesterly winds[@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
- [[Landes forest]] in the south also moderates temperatures nad protects from strong oceanic winds [@oxcomp_bordeaux, p. 556].
- more continental climate in St-Émilion and Pomerol [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
- mild, damp spring.
- warm to hot summers
- humid autumns
- in Sauternes the Ciron converges with the Garonne

### 2. Soil Types

- left bank:
	- bas-medoc
		- clay heavy [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
	- haut-medoc
		- well-draining gravelly soil [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
		- best chateaux on gravel mounds called *croupes* [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
		- note: Margaux has a diverse range of soils relative to the other sub-regions of the Haut-Medoc [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
	- Graves
		- similar to Médoc but more sand [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
- right bank
	- St-Emilion
		- 2 soil types, *côtes* and *graves*.
			- *côtes*: steep limestone hillsides [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
			- *graves*: gravelly limestone plateaus [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
	- Pomerol
		- sand, gravel and topsoil of iron pan and rich class called *crasse de fer* [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
		- note: Petrus is distinct for its subsoil clays very close to the surface [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024].
	- Boug and Cotes de Bourg
		- limestone soil [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]

## Production

TODO:

- [ ] for each sub-topic collect notes from the resources noted above.

### 11. Grape Varietals

- black grapes: cabernet sauvignon merlot, cabernet franc, petit verdot, malbec, Carmenère [@guildsomm_bordeaux_2024]
- white grapes: Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc, Muscadelle [@wset_bordeaux]

### 12. Blending - Importance of Varietal in the Blend

- blending *assemblage* is important as vintages in Bordeaux vary and the variety that performs best one vintage may not perform so well in the next. Primarily a mix of early and late blooming / ripening varieties, i.e. Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon, which protects from sporadic spring frost or rain at harvest guarantees a consistently quality and profitable harvest year on year. These varieties are also sensitive to soil types and since Bordeaux has a diverse range of soils, varieties with an affinity for one soil, say Merlot in clay, can carry the blend where say Cabernet Sauvignon is struggling to perform, and vice versa.

### 3. & 5. Production and Aging Techniques (Barrique Fermentation/Ageing)

- viticulture
	- green harvest:
		- commonly used to reduce vigor to produce smaller berries for a more concentrated wine [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- sorting:  
		- fruit sorted by quality to isolate the densest, best fruit for a *grand vin*. Sorting is done optically (fruit appearance) and mechanically via a density sorter (float fruit in a water bath, fruit that sinks is dense enough for a *grand vin*) [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- fruit preparation
	- destemming is common [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- preprocessing
	- chaptalization is permissible [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- water content removal by vacuum distillation or reverse osmosis can be seen in wetter and cooler vintages [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- fermentation
	- vessel:
		- red:
			- all kinds of vessels used: large wood casks, stainless steel tank, buried expoxy-lined concrete vat, naked cement vat[@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- white:
			- dry and sweet typically fermented in barrique [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- estates may blend different vessel batches together to create a style [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- cap management:
		- *remontage* (pump over) is traditional [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
		- *pigeage* is sometimes used but run the risk of over-extraction in varieties like CS [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- MLF:
		- reds:
			- MLF used for reds generally 3 months after harvest [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- whites:
			- no MLF unless overly acidic [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- micro-oxygenation:
		- used to soften green, rustic and tannic edges [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
- élevage
	- formats
		- variety of formats used - oak barrique, concrete, steel [@wset_bordeaux]
		- red *grand vin*: 18 - 24 months, typically in 100% new oak in a range of cooperage styles [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		- white: 12 - 15 months in barrel, 50% new oak [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- [[racking]]:
		- maximum of once every three months. [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- [[cliquage]] may be used [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
- assemblage
	- two schools of thought:
		1. performed early in the year after harvest prior to [[en primeur]] in April so the foundation of the finished wine can be judged[@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
		2. after [[en primeur]] just before bottling to enable each component to mature individually for as long as possible [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].
	- occurs 6 months after harvest [@wset_bordeaux]
- clarification and stabilisation
	- finding and filtration common, either one or the other or both, or neither. [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
- bottling
	- bottling done end of April after harvest [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]
	- closure:
		- Cork is used universally [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert].

### 4. Botrytis Wine Production

## Business

### 16. Trade Structure - En Primeur, Negociants

#### Trade Structure

- historically, chateaux would produce the wine, négociants would sell the wine, and primarily in the Médoc courtiers would broker deals between chateaux and négociants. [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert]

#### En Primeur

#### Negociants

## Localities

### 6. Districts, Subdistricts and Location

### 13. Styles of Wine from Principal Production Districts

## Classifications

There is a [[Graves Classification]].

### 15. Labelling Terms

### 14. Quality Levels, AOP, IGP

Note that AOC is provided by the French government, while AOP is part of the EU PDO [@guildsomm_frenchwinelaw_2024].

AOC and AOP are for the most part interchangeable, AOC is provided and enforced by the French Government, AOP by the EU [@wiki_aoc, sec. 'Product coverage'].

#### AOC of Bordeaux

There are 47 AOC in Bordeaux [@wiki_bordeauxaop].

Most notable [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert, sec. 'Winegrowing Regions of Bordeaux']:

- Medoc:
	- Medoc
	- Haut-Medoc
	- St-Estèphe
	- Pauillac
	- St-Julien
	- Margaux
- Graves
	- [[Graves AOP]]
	- [[Graves Supérieur AOP]]
	- [[Pessac-Léognan AOC]]
	- [[Sauternes AOP]]
	- Barsac AOP

### 7. Classification System 1855

#### First Growths

```csvtable

```

### 9. St Emillion Classification

### 3. (Certified) Cru Bourgeois Classification

Introduced in 1932, it originally included 444 properties excluded from the 1855 classification, introduced to provide marketing during the Great Depression and included three tiers: *cru bourgeois exceptionnel*, *cru bourgeois supérieur*, and *cru bourgeois*. It was however banned in 2007 after a controversial reclassification. After much reorganisation it settled in 2020 with 249 châteaux, 14 *crus bourgeois exceptionnels*, 56 *crus bourgeois supérieurs*, to be reviewed every 5 years [@guildsomm_bordeauxexpert, sec. "Other Classifications of the Médoc: Cru Bourgeois and Cru Artisan"].

## Chateaux

### 8. Top Médoc Chateaux and Location

### 2. (Certified) Location of Top Bordeaux Properties

### 10. "A" Category St Émilion Châteaux

### 1. (Certified) Well Known 1st - 5th Classified Growths from the Médoc, Sauternes, St Émillion and Pessac Leognan

## Vintages
