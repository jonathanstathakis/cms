## Study Plan

I think it is best to study the technical topics first then the taxonomic so that I can apply the technical logic to these problems, and practice the food and wine pairing logic, deductive tasting, service aspects, etc. After that we should tackle the most difficult topics first - Burgundy, Bordeaux, Champagne, Germany, etc. Thus, a study plan is as follows:

1. [ ] [[cms_deductivetasting|Deductive Tasting]]
2. [ ] [[cms_foodandwinepairings|Food and Wine Pairings]]
3. [ ] [[cms_viticultureandvinification|Viticulture and Vinification]]
4. [ ] [[cms_businessaspects|Business Aspects]]
5. [ ] [[cms_practicalserviceaspects|Practical Service Aspects]]
6. [ ] [[bordeaux|Bordeaux]]
7. [ ] [[cms_burgundy|Burgundy]]
8. [ ] [[cms_italy|Italy]]
9. [ ] [[cms_champagne|Champagne]]
10. [ ] [[cms_sparkling_wines|Sparkling Wines]]
11. [ ] [[cms_germany|Germany]]
12. [ ] [[cms_austria|Austria]]
13. [ ] [[cms_alsace|Alsace]]
14. [ ] [[cms_loire|Loire]]
15. [ ] [[cms_rhonevalley|Rhone Valley]]
16. [ ] [[cms_southoffrance|South of France]]
17. [ ] [[cms_spain|Spain]]
18. [ ] [[cms_portugal|Portugal]]
19. [ ] [[cms_greece|Greece]]
20. [ ] [[cms_europe|Europe]]
21. [ ] [[cms_australia|Australia]]
22. [ ] [[cms_newzealand|New Zealand]]
23. [ ] [[cms_unitedstatesandcanada|United States and Canada]]
24. [ ] [[cms_southamerica|South America]]
25. [ ] [[cms_southafrica|South Africa]]
26. [ ] [[cms_othernewworldwines|Other New World Wines]]
27. [ ] [[cms_fortifiedwines|Fortified Wines]]
28. [ ] [[cms_spirits|Spirits]]
29. [ ] [[cms_aperitifwinesliqueursandbitters|Aperitif wines, Liqueurs and Bitters]]
30. [ ] [[cms_beersandciders|Beers and Ciders]]
31. [ ] [[cms_sake|Saké]]

But how to study? It would be great if I could assemble notes for all the topics by half way to the exam then revise for the remainder. That would require assembling notes on 4 topics a week. Doable. That's the plan then. 7 weeks to assemble all the notes, then revise afterwards.
