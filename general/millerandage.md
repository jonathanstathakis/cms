Also known as chicken berries, *millerandage* describes a bunch of grapes wherein a quantity of the fruit does not mature normally, resulting in small green berries lacking seeds. It can be caused by poor fruit set, and the consequence is a reduction in yield of wine, although some consider it to also impart higher qualities to the final product [@oxcomp_bordeaux, pp. 2242].
