An essential part of the Ã©levage of a wine. Racking is the transport of a maturing wine liquid away from a developed sediment layer. Typically wine is pumped out of its present vessel and the sediment is removed. Traditionally it is used to remove a newly fermented wine from its gross lees, and in cooler regions another racking is performed after winter frosts precipitate some tartrates. The first racking may be followed by a second and third in the first year and a fourth and fifth in the second year if required. More common in Old World than the New. It provides clarification and aeration, where aeration is essential for the formation of pigmented tannins and minimize reduction in the wine [@robinson_Oxfordcompanionwine_2015].
