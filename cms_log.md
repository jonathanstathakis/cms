# CMS Intro, Certified Log

This log will follow the following format: each new entry begins with the current datetime followed by a hyphen, followed by the entry contents. No new lines are allowed in an entry, and ideally its restricted to one sentence. Any writing that requires longer prose deserves a dedicated file.

## Entries

2025-01-28T11:53:22 - First log entry. Time to finish Bordeaux. Rather than reading any more guides I will focus on Syllabus-focused information collection. Resources to use are the World Atlas of Wine and Wikipedia.
