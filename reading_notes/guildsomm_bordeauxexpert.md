## Bordeaux: Frances Largest Vineyard

- 117,500 hectares under vine (2011) means more area under vine than any other region in France.
- 14% French total vineyard area.
- 5 - 6 million hectolitres of wine every year.
- average of 14.5 hectares per domaine.
- 8000 winegrowers (?).
- 130km long and 75 km wide.
- 2 major rivers - Garonne and Dordogne.
- Garonne and Dordogne converge into the Gironde Estuary prior to joining the Atlantic.
- Most of Bordeaux appellation is within the Gironde departement except for a stretch of coastal forest.
- Bordeaux is divided into 5 sub regions:
	- Médoc
	- Graves
	- Entre-Deux-Mers
	- The Right Bank
	- Blaye and Bourg
- Médoc and Graves constitute the Left Bank
- Saint-Émillion, Pomerol, Fronsac and surrounding appellations constitute the Right Bank. Sometimes Blaye and Bourg are included.
- Entre-Deux-Mers sits between the Garonne and Dordogne.

## Bordeaux Climates

- influenced by Atlantic Ocean (maritime climate), whose effects are channelled inland through the Gironde Estuary.
- maritme climate = warm summers, cool winters, tempered extremes.
- rainfall evenly dispersed throughout the year, no dry season.
- Médoc most rainfall of any major French wine region.
- Hazard: rainfall can interrupt flowering in spring, reducing yield. Rot is also a concern.
- Due to rainfall, Bordeaux climate is unpredictable year on year - sunshine one year, disastrous amounts of rain the next.
- Unpredictable climate and weather events means change in vintage quality year on year, and accordingly, fluctuating prices (esp. in more premium wines)
- Warm water from Caribbean sucked up by the Atlantic Gulf Stream keeps Bordeaux climate mild even though its just south of the 45th parallel (?)
- severe spring frost or dangerously cold winters occur rarely.
- Cabernet Sauvignon and Petit Verdot are late-ripening varieties who are susceptible to Autumn rain and cold weather

## The Grapes of Bordeaux

- Bordeaux AOP:
	- 6 red varieties:
		- Merlot
		- Cabernet Sauvignon
		- Cabernet Franc
		- Petit Verdot
		- Malbec
		- Carmenère
		- 99% of vineyard area dedicated to Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Cabernet Franc.
	- White Varieties
		- Sémillon
		- Sauvignon Blanc
		- Sauvignon Gris
		- Muscadelle
		- Ugni Blanc (minor)
		- Merlot Blanc (minor)
		- Colombard (minor)
- Phylloxera and the winter of 1956 destroyed many vineyards, consequently vineyards have reduced variation of varieties.
- 89% of vineyard area is dedicated to black grapes.
- Merlot most planted black vine.
- Sémillon most planted white vine.
- significance of blends:
	- Bordeaux tends toward blends.
	- Insurance against bad weather. Blends provide insurance as different varieties bud, ripen at different times and rates so adverse weather events don't impact all varieties equally - for example frost damaging early budding varieties, autumn rains affecting late ripening varieties. Another example is weakness to rot and coulure - more rain means more rot etc.
	- Soil Composition. Different varieties like different soils - for example Merlot prefers cool clay soils, Cabernet warmer gravel.
	- Blending Complementary Flavors. Bordeaux varieties are complementary in character, each providing elements to the final assembly.
- Varieties of Bordeaux are related:
	- Cabernet Franc + Sauvignon Blanc = Cabernet Sauvignon. Franc -> Merlot, Carmenere. Merlot and Malbec are half-siblings sharing a parent Magdeleine Noire des Charentes.
	- Relation means similar flavors - Pyrazine (2-methoxy-3-isobutylpyrazine) character (bell pepper, grass, sage) common in Cabernet Franc, Carmenere, Cabernet Sauvignon, Sauvignon Blanc. Of the family, only Malbec does not show pyrazine.
	- Note that Petit Verdot and Muscadelle are not related to the other varieties.

### Merlot

- 63% of red wine plantings
- dominant grape in vast majority of right bank wines, rising in popularity in left bank (Northern Médoc, Graves where there are non-gravel soils).
- In Médoc and Haut-Médoc AOP constitutes up to half the blend.
- Increasing in popularity in Saint-Estèphe and in many second wines.
- buds and ripens 2 weeks earlier than CS
- inclined toward high yields
- for premium wine:
	- cool soils (e.g. clay) to slow ripening
	- severe pruning
- vulnerable to rot: thin skin compared to CS
- vulnerable to coloure because of early budding
- less susceptible to wood-rotting diseases i.e. Eutypa dieback
- longer lived than Cabernet Sauvignon - can reach 100 years of age
- Cabernet Sauvignon only lives 60 years.
- warmer vintages can result in over-production of sugar - 2009, 2010 saw potential alcohols of 16%.
- contribution to blends: lush blue and plum fruit, expansive mid-palate, alcohol warmth. in the right bank it produces fleshy, supply, generous wines appreciated by those with an inclination to fruit.

### Cabernet Sauvignon

- 25% of plantings
- gravel soil of left bank allows it to ripen fully.
- thick skins = more resistant to rot.
- tannic, phenolic.

### Cabernet Franc

- 11% of vineyard plantings
- in blends it is usually subordinate.
- Has been replaced by Merlot in importance.
- Used in the right bank to add acidity and aromatics to Merlot

### Malbec

- prior to its import to Bordeaux, it was known as Pressac Noir. A Bordelais grower named Malbec brought the grape to Bordeaux and bestowed its local name upon it.
- Shrinking in importance.

### Petit Verdot

- used in the left bank in very small proportions to add color, spice, floral perfume and tannin to Cabernet Sauvignon.

### Sémillon

- ~45% of white plantings.
- thin skin: prone to botrytis.
- makes waxy and rich dry whites, balancing sauvignon blanc.

### Sauvignon Blanc

- ~43% vineyard plantings
- typically the dominant varietal in white blends.
- Sauvignon Gris is a mutation of Sauvignon Blanc but is genetically identical.

### Muscadelle

- ~5% white vineyard plantings
- flowery, grapey, intense aromatics.
- used like petit verdot - small proportions to accentuate a blend.

## The Modern AOP System in Bordeaux

- 39 AOP in Bordeaux
- 3 regional appellations apply within whole Bordeaux:
	- Bordeaux AOP
	- Bordeaux Supérieur AOP
	- Crémant de Bordeaux AOP
- Subregional AOPs:
	- Médoc AOP
	- Entre-Deux-Mers AOP
	- Côtes de Bordeaux AOP
- village appellations:
	- Pomerol AOP
	- Margaux AOP
	- Sauternes AOP

### Bordeaux AOP

- red, white, rosé and clairet - dry, off-dry and medium sweet.

### Bordeaux Supérieur AOP

- red and medium sweet whites
- requires:
	- reds to undergo élevage until mid-June of the year following harvest (approx 6 months longer)
	- higher minimum vine density, lower yield per hectare, more vines per hectare (increase stress = better wine)
	- lower maximum allowed yield
	- require higher minimum alcohol
- Based on using ripeness as predictor for quality - outdated assumption as modern viticulture able to achieved ripeness easily (also climate).
- Typical Bordeaux Supérieur wine:
	- Merlot dominant.
	- aged in older barriques.
	- may use American oak
	- may use oak chips.
	- machine harvest.
	- 6 - 15 euros in cost.

### Crémant De Bordeaux AOP

- white and rosé sparkling wines.
- traditional method
- at least 9 months on lees.
- small level of production - approximately 200 ha in Gironde départment (out of 99,750 ha, or 0.2%)

### Vin De Pays (IGP) in Bordeaux

- Bordeaux is included in the *Atlantique* IGP which includes the départments of Gironde, Chaente and Charente-Maritime, Dordogne and west of Lot-et-Garone.
- Can include all styles of wine and a vast array of varieties.
- Typically users of this designation are in Bergerac, Duras or Cognac rather than Bordeaux.

## History of Bordeaux

*skipped.*

### The 1855 Classification

- A list of the top Bordeaux estates
- created by *courtiers* on request by Emperor Napoleon III for the 1855 Universal Exposition.
- Ranked based on price: Médoc Reds and Sauturnes stickies most expensive at the time (still are)
- excluded Right Bank, Graves (except for Haut-Brion)
- classification of reds:
	- included 57 chateaux
	- chateaux were divided into 5 categories called *growths* (?) under the top level *grand cru classé*
	- first growths:
		- Lafite
		- Latour
		- Margeaux
		- Haut-Brion
- classification of stickies:
	- 21 chateaux
	- 3 categories: *second cru*, *premiers crus*, *premier cru supérieur* (Château d'Yquem)
- changes in status of chateaux over time has added 4 chateaux to the red classification for a total of 61, 27 classified for white (sticky or dry?)
- in 1973 Château Mouton-Rothschild was elevated to premier cru classé
- Not the first time classification of Bordeaux was attempted, but certainly the most enduring.
- a controversial classification - benefits the original included, detracts from less privleged producers.

### Disease

- Between 1852 and 1869 three American diseases struck Bordeaux - oidium (powdery mildew), peronospera (downy mildew) and phylloxera.
- oidium was treated with sulfur
- phylloxera was treated by replanting and grafting with resistant rootstock or opting for hybrid vines.
- downy mildew was treated with Bordeaux Mixture (copper sulfate + lime)
- result of these three diseases is that Bordeaux Mixture is applied routinely and most all vineyards in Bordeaux are grafted on phylloxera-resistant rootstock.
- The need for grafting disadvantages poorly graftable vines such as Malbec and Carmenere who have consequently reduced in importance in the area - overall the diversity of varieties has reduced.

### 20th Century Blues and Revival

*skipped, but interesting.*

...

## The Place De Bordeaux and *En Primeur*

- 3 tiered production, brokerage and sales system that evolved in Bordeaux during the second millennium.
- Production (château):
	- traditionally operated by aristocracy or church
- Sales (*négociant):
	- merchant class
	- first established in 1600's by dutch and english traders, Germans, Irish followed in 1700's
- Broker (*courtier*):
	- appeared in 1800's due to emergence of new estates in Médoc - established négociants of the time dealt with estates in Graves.
	- Acted as intermediaries between *châteaus* and *négociants*.

### *En Primeur*

- the sales of **yet to be released** wines (i.e. futures) by châteaux to négociants was common in Bordeaux (takes advantage of good years, smoothing out cashflow)
- Initially a Bordeaux B2B system, attention from Robert Parker etc. brought public interest.
- Current system - tasting of wine is performed, wines are scored, prices announced and futures released for purchase. Futures are released in successively more expensive tranches until all are sold.
- Can be a 2 year wait for the futures to become wine - for bottles to be released after maturation.
- Future prices can fluctuate wildly.
- Notably, Château Latour opted out entirely in 2012 and onwards.

## Bordeaux Vineyard Ownership: The Brand Model

## Viticulture in Bordeaux

### Training

- guyot system
	- left bank: double
	- right bank: simple
	- tends to produce larger berries more susceptible to grey rot
- sweet wines: cordon - makes smaller berries better for botrytis infetion.

### Vineyard Density

- left bank:
	- premier appellatoins of Médoc require minimum 7,000 vines per hectare
	- common for high density 1 x 1 meter spacing similar to Côte d'Or.
- right bank:
	- Pomerol and St Émilion require minimum 5500 vines per hectare, rows separated by 1.3 - 1.5 meters. This is because soils are shallower and vineroot spreads outwards rather than down.
- Entre-Deux-Mers
	- lowest density, Bordeaux AOP allows a maximum of 2.5 meters between vines.
- height
	- left bank:
		- common in medoc for bunches to hand 1 meter off the ground to maximise absorbance of radiant heat from gravel.
	- right bank:
		- higher canopies than left bank because frost is more common.

### Organic and Biodynamic Practices

- Bordeaux moving toward organic.
- hard because of wet weather, rot, mildew
- in 2017 8% of Bordeaux vineyards were certified organic, on par with national average.
- due to environmental threats, producers tend to *lutte raisonnée* (practical organic - a conservative approach to the use of non-organic practices) rather than strict organic.
- Bordeaux mixture, sulfer and similar concoctions are technically organic
- deleafing and greenery stripping around fruit after *véraison* are methods of managing disease without chemicals.
- biodynamic practice is increasing, for example Pontet-Canet.

## Winemaking Practices in Bordeaux

### Viticulture

- Viticulture
	- green harvesting is common. It is used to reduce vigor, producing smaller berries resulting in a more concentrated wine

### Picking and Preprocessing

- sorting of fruit by quality. Done by hand, optical sorter and density sorter (only the densest fruit goes into *grand vin*)
- destemming is common
- chaptalization can be used
- removal of water content by vacuum distallation or reverse osmosis - typically used in wet and cool vintages.

### Fermentation

- every kind of vessel is used: large wood casks, stainless steel tank, buried expoxy-lined concrete vat, naked cement vat.
- dry and sweet whites wines typically ferment in barrique
- some estates blend batches of different fermentation styles to match varietal or parcel character.
- cap management:
	- typically use *remontage* (pumping over [@robinson_Oxfordcompanionwine_2015])
	- some producers use *pigeage* - risky with rich black grapes such as CS as can overextract phenols and color
- MLF:
	- reds undergo MLF in tank or barrel, typically at the end of harvest year (harvest is in September [@dombrowski_whatexpectgrape_2020]), so 3 months after harvest.
	- whites are typically not MLF unless overly acidic.
- micro-oxygenation
	- used to soften green, rustic and tannic edges.

### Élevage

 - *grand vin*:
	- spend 18 - 24 months maturing
	- typically entirely in new oak, generally a range of coopering styles.
	- racking:
		- at most once every three months.
- whites can spend 12 - 15 months in barrel, at most 50% new oak.
- oxygenation *cliquage*:
	- controversial
	- small volumes of oxygen applied to a finished wine in barrel to simulate oxygenation introduced via racking
	- proponents claim it balances reduction introduced through bâtonnage
	- critics state that it benefits quality in the short term at the cost of long-term bottle maturation.

### *assemblage*

- either done early in the year after harvest prior to *en primeur* tasting in April of that year (*en primeur* judges the wine in barrel, not in bottle) or after the tasting just prior to bottling.
- thus for the best wines they either mature for the extent of their time as a blend or as individuals.

### Fining and Filtration

- both are common, however exceptions exist.

### Bottling

- bottling is done the April after harvest.
- cork closure universal but not required.

## Winegrowing Regions of Bordeaux

### The Left Bank

#### The Médoc

- Divided into the northern Bas-Médoc (lower Médoc) and southern Haut-Médoc (upper).
- Atlantic to the north, Gironde estuary to the east.
- winegrowing occurs within a dozen km of the Gironde.
- best vineyards and chateaux in Haut-Médoc.
- Landes forest to the west shield vineyards from ocean winds.
- flat terrain except for gentle slopes of gravel *croupes*.
- eight AOP in Médoc:
  - Médoc AOP (usually used for wines from Bas-Médoc)
  - Haut-Médoc AOP. and within Haut-Médoc AOP the commune appellations of..:
    - Saint-Estèphe AOP
    - Pauillac AOP
    - Saint-Julien AOP
    - Margaux AOP
    - Listrac-Médoc AOP
    - Moulis AOP

##### Saint-Estèphe AOP

- Northernmost evidence of *croupes* formation surrounded by low-lying clay and sandy soil.
- Divided from Pauillac by the Jalle de Breuil.
- Cos d'Estournel, Montrose are notable chateaux from the AOP.
- style is described as rustic, aggressive, and sturdy, requiring many years to yield.
- Increasing use of Merlot is softening the style.
- 5 classified estates in total.

##### Pauillac AOP

- possesses the deepest croupes.
- most important site for Cabernet Sauvignon in Bordeaux.
- 3 first growths.
- Lafite-Rothschild most northern, Latour most southern.
- very much predominately cabernet, 70 - 80% of total encépagement, in warm vintages the assemblage of the *grands vin* is 80 - 95% CS.
- The style is power - dark, firm, brooding wines requiring extensive cellaring.

##### Saint-Julien AOP

- no first growths, 11 classified growths in total.
- Dominated by CS.
- reflects a middle ground of styles - elegence approaching Margaux, power approaching Pauillac.

##### Margaux AOP

- Includes the communes of Margaux-Cantenac, Soussans, Arsac and Labarde.
- includes more variety of soil than comparative commune AOPs.
- the gravel is shallower means that CS ripens slightly earlier.
- sand, limestone, clay as well especially in the outskirts.
- 65% CS
- 21 classified growths.
- Chateau Palmer is a very notable chateaux that is a 3rd growth.
- the style is aromatic, silkier and slightly lighter in body compared with the more northern communes.

##### Moulis and Listrac AOPs

- More inland than the comparative AOPs
- Moulis contains some Cru Bourgeois chateaux such as Chasse-Spleen and Poujeaux.
- Listrac was the last commune AOP assigned, in 1957.
- Due to inland location, CS does not ripen as dependably and Merlot is being planted more.

##### Graves

- Graves extends from Bordeaux city to Langon, following the Garonne west.
- Landes forest protects the area from the sea.
- produces dry whites, dry reds and sweet whites.
- dominated by gravel soils.
- Northern Graves famous for some of best reds and whites in Bordeaux.
- Northern Graves posseses *croupes* like those of Médoc.
- AOP's
  - Graves AOP
  - Graves Supérieur AOP
  - Pessac-Léognan AOP
- Graves AOP
  - allows for dry red and white wines.
  - tends to be used for produces from the more mediocre south.
- Graves Supérieur AOP
  - sweet whites
  - 40 - 50 g/L residual sugar.

##### Graves Classification

- started in 1953, finalised in 1959.
- commisioned by *courtiers* and sanctioned by INAO
- one category: *cru classé*.
- 15 châteaux included.
- 7 châteaux were classified for red wines
- 2 châteaux were classified for white wines
- 6 for both red and white wines
- in 1968 Château Couhins, which was classified for whites, split into 2, both new properties were added to the classification, increasing the number of included châteaux to 16.
- While it is not immutable no review has been conducted.
- La Tour Haut-Brion stopped production in 2005 and Laville Haut-Brion in 2008, so while the classification includes 16 châteaux, only 14 are producing wine (they instead supply fruit for Château La Mission Haut-Brion).

##### Pessac-Léognan AOP

- formed in the 80's.
- allows for dry red and white wines.
- 80% red.
- Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in equal proportion.
- includes Château Haut-Brion.
- Haut-Brion includes more Merlot than CS.
- dry whites produces in the area are a blend of Sémillon and Sauvignon Blanc although examples of 100% SB exist.

##### Sauternes AOP and Barsac AOP

- located in Southern Graves along left bank of Garonne
- Sauternes AOP includes the commons of Sauternes, Bommes, Preignac, and Barsac. Barsac does have its own AOP but generally Sauternes AOP is used anyway as it has more prestige.
- Sauternes AOP is outside Graves AOP. Consequently they can't produce a dry white wine in any AOP apart from Bordeaux AOP.
- sweet wines produced from Sémillon, Sauvignon Blanc and Muscadelle.
- created alongside infection by Botrytis cinerea, otherwise known as *pourriture noble* or 'noble rot'.
- production of this style of wine dates from at least 18th century in Sauternes.
- Sauternes vineyards located at confluence of Ciron and Garonne which encourages development of morning mists and humidity in early autumn, which in turn encourages development of botyrtis infection.
- effect of botyrtis:
	- botrytis pierces grape skin resulting in fruit dehydration - concentrating sugar, acidity and glycerol
	- adds honey, saffron, ginger spice, dried fruit and iodine characters.
- botrytis does not affect evenly thus several passes (*tries*) during picking are required for consistent results. Thus is mandated by AOP law. Usually 3 or 4 passes are performed.
- Quite possible that a vintage will produce a poor botrytised crop and thus the wine will not be made that year.
- Use of new oak is common.
- barrel fermentation is common.
- top wines are fermented in barrique followed by élevage in the same vessel.
- sulfur dixoide is used liberally to prevent development of volatile acidity and secondary fermentation.
- Chaptalization and cryo-extraction are permitted.
- Sauternes can hit 14% alcohol with a residual sugar range of 120 - 160 g/L.
- the wine is described as viscous, golden, textural with fragrant tones of new oak and botrytis.

##### Cérons AOP

- Includes communes of Cérons, Podensac and Illats.
- sweet whites.
- compared with Sauternes:
  - Botrytis develops less reliably
  - permitted yields are higher
  - resulting wines are less concentrated.
  - less production of botrytised wines as production costs for quality of final product dont match.

### The Right Bank

- Includes the appellations of Saint-Émilion, Pomerol, Fronsac and their satellites.
- 10 AOP's in total.
- Can include Bourg and Blaye and Côtes de Bordeaux.
- Produce red exclusively, except Bourg and Blaye which does produce some white.
- elevation increases as one moves west reaching 90 meters compared to Médoc topping out at 30 meters.
- less gravel, more cool clay and calcareous clay - better for Merlot than CS.
- Generally the encépagement is 70% Merlot, 30% Cabernet Franc.
- Merlot ripens happily in the cooler soil, is less susceptible to disease, evenly ripening and longer-lived wine than CF.
- Merlot began adoption after Phylloxera and increasingly so after the freeze and frosts of 1956 killed established vines.
- Merlot has thinner skin making it susceptible to rot. In response to this INAO encouraged growers to replace it with CS however CS does not perform well in the area.
- CF provides bright acidity and restrained alcohol to the blend.
- no appellation provided for white wines in the Right Bank apart from Bordeaux AOP.
- Fronsac has the highest proportion of chinese owned estates.
- garagiste movement:
  - started in Saint-Emilion
  - small production
  - low-yielding
  - severe selection
  - lots of new oak.
  - favor winemaking over terroir to compensate for the provinence of the fruit - lesser vineyards.

#### Saint-Émilion AOP and Saint-Émilion Grand Cru AOP

- historic sites on côtes of limestone plateau near Saint-Émilion commune.
- the top of the plateau hosts cool clay soil favoring Merlot.
- due to the plateau, most Saint-Émilion classified chateaux are clustered around the commune.
- Pomerol contains a gravel terrace.
- more gravel than clay, favors CF.
- Château Figeac is a notable grower of quality CS, situated between the gravel of Pomerol and Saint-Emilion.
- Cheval Blanc also located here, more CF than Merlot.
- soil types are divided between *côtes* and *graves*.
- every *premier grand cru classé* is either in *côtes* or *graves*.
- Saint Émilion has 2 red wine only AOPs: "Saint Émilion" AOP (1936) and "Sant-Émilion Grand Cru" AOP (1954). One difference between the two is that the former can be négocient bottled, wheras the latter must be estate-bottled. ALso the later requires longer élevage
- most Grand Cru AOP estates are on the côtes.
- classified estates must produce Grand Cru AOP wines (?)
- "Saint-Émilion Grand Cru" = appellation. “Saint-Émilion Grand Cru Classé” = classified producer within the appellation.

#### The Saint-Émilion Classification

- drafted with consent from the INAO
- conducted by INAO based on soil analysis, topography, viticulture and enology and a decade long vertical tasting.
- reviewed every 10 years - last was in 2022.
- 4 tiers: premier grand cru classé A and B, grand cru classé, grand cru.
- current standing:
  - premier grand cru classé A:
    - Pavie, Figeac
  - premier grand cru classé B:
    - 12 estates
  - grand cru classé:
    - 71
  - grand cru:
    - ?
- to be classified the wine must be sold within the Place de Bordeaux

#### Pomerol AOP

- most important site for Merlot
- bounded by the Isle and Barbanne rivers and Libourne
- Cheval Blanc, Petrus are notable chateaux.
- Petrus possesses blue clay soil.
- Petrus produces 100% merlot grand vin in most years.
- POmerols soils conist of gravel interwoven with clay and ion rich sand dubbed *crasse de fer*.
- Pomerol consists of three rising terraces with the lowest near Liborune and running north east (?)
- terrace 1: light sandy soil.
- gravel soils enable the fruit to ripen earlier than St Émilion.
- Petrus is centered on the *buttonière*, or buttonhole - deep blue clay. Cheval blanc on this soil too.
- While Merlot took over from Cabernet Franc in the mid 20th century, global warming has growers looking yet again to CF to contend with Merlot's eagerness to overripen.
- notable chateaux include:
  - Petrus
  - Veux Château Certan
  - Lafleur
  - l'Evangile
  - Trotanoy
  - Clinet
  - la Conseillante
  - Petit Village
  - Le Pin
  - le Bon Pasteur
- position on the plateau predicts the soil composition which in turn predicts wine quality and cost.
- no classification system in Pomerol.
- two styles coexist: rich, luxurious new world-esque examples and classic hard-edged, tannic wines.

#### Fronsac AOP and Canon-Fronsac AOP

- Fronsac was historically renowned but faded into mediocrity after Phylloxera.
- Fronsac is divided by Lalande-de-Pomerol by the Isle river and from Entre-Deux-Mers by the Dordogne.
- Commonly high to completely Merlot wines.
- Canon-Fronsac held in higher esteem.
- Notable châteaux: Grand-Renouil, Gaby, Dalem, de La Dauphine, Fontenil.

#### Right Bank Satellites

- 4 AOPs orbit Saint-Émilion:
  - Lussac-Saint-Émilion AOP
  - Puisseguin-Saint-Émilion AOP
  - Montagne-Saint-Émilion AOP
  - Saint-Georges-Saint-Émilion AOP.
  - Merlot dominant
  - notable producers:
    - Producteurs Réunis
- 1 AOPs orbit Pomerol:
  - Lalande-de-Pomerol AOP

#### Entre-Deux-Mers

- Entre-Deux-Mers AOP allows red and whites.
- base-level wines - lighter, generic, no new oak, immediate consumption.

#### Côtes de Bordeaux

- unification of outlying appellations under one label.
- Includes:
  - Premières Côtes de Bordeaux (western edge of Entre-Deux-Mers)
  - An area adjacent to the eastern border of St-Émilion and Puisseguin-Saint-Émilion AOPs
  - an area between Entre-Deux-Mers and Bergerac.
  - Blaye AOP (which remains as a seperate apellation)
- Merlot-based red wine
- different requirements based on a geographic sub-designation: Castillon, Francs, Cadillac, Blaye and Sainte-Foy.
- Blaye, Francs and Sainte-Foy can produce white wine as well.
- Cadillac AOP is sweet white wine only.
- Côtes de Bordeaux AOP is sweet white wine only.

#### Bourg and Blaye

- located far north of Right Bank across from Médoc.
- Wine production since Roman times.
- Already fading in importance by the 19th century, Phylloxera was a death knell
- Lots of its production headed to Cognac prior to their delimitation in 1909.
- Bourg AOP:
  - red and white wines (not much white).
  - Merlot blended with CS.
  - most notable produer is Roc de Cambes.
- Blaye AOP:
  - red wine.
  - red wines can be labelled Blaye AOP, Côtes de Bordeaux AOP.
  - Blaye AOP requires sale ~ 18 months (?) after harvest minimum.
- Côtes de Blaye AOP can be used to sell white blends of Ugni Blanc and Colombard.
